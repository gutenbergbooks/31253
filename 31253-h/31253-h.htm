	<h2><a class="pagenum disguise" id="pageiii" title="iii"> </a>PREFACE.</h2>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> Author of the following Observations,
	made during <strong class="special_emphasis">A MORNING’S
	WALK</strong>, will doubtless be allowed
	to possess but a moderate degree of
	literary ambition. He has not qualified
	himself, by foreign travels, to
	transport his readers above the
	clouds, on the Andes, the Alps, or
	the <ins id="fix_1" title="was ‘Appenines’">Apennines</ins>; to alarm them by
	descriptions of Earthquakes, or
	Eruptions; or to astonish them by
	accounts of tremendous Chasms,
	Caverns, and Cataracts: but he has
	restricted his researches to subjects
	of home scenery, which thousands
	can daily examine after him; and
	consequently has not enjoyed that
	<a class="pagenum" id="pageiv" title="iv"> </a><em>latitude</em> of fancy, or been able to
	exercise any of those rare powers
	of <em>hearing</em> and <em>seeing</em>, by means
	of which travellers into distant
	regions are enabled to stimulate
	curiosity and monopolize fame.</p>

	<p>The class of readers who seek
	for sources of pleasure beyond the
	ordinary course of nature, will
	therefore feel disappointment in
	attempting to follow a pedestrian
	tourist through a route so destitute
	of wonders. Nor will this feeling,
	it is to be feared, be confined to
	searchers after supernatural phenomena
	in regard to the facts which
	appertain to such a work. In the
	sentiments which accompany his
	narrations, it will be found that the
	Author, accustomed to think for
	himself, admits no standards of
	truth superior to the evidence of
	<a class="pagenum" id="pagev" title="v"> </a>the senses and the deductions of
	reason; consequently, that his conclusions
	on many important topics
	are at variance with existing practices,
	whenever it appears they have
	no better foundation than the continuity
	of prejudices and the arbitrary
	laws of custom. He therefore
	entertains very serious doubts
	whether his work will be acceptable
	to those <em class="special_name">learned Professors</em>
	in Universities, who teach no doctrines
	or opinions but those of
	their predecessors; or whether it
	will suit <em class="special_name">Students</em>, whose advancement
	depends on their submission
	to the dogmata of such superiors.
	He questions whether it will ever
	be quoted as an authority by
	<em class="special_name">Statesmen</em> who consider the will
	of princes as standards of wisdom;—by
	<em class="special_name">Legislators</em> who barter
	<a class="pagenum" id="pagevi" title="vi"> </a>away their votes, and decide on the
	presumed integrity of ministers and
	leaders;—by <em class="special_name">Politicians</em> who banish
	the moral feelings from their
	practices;—or by <em class="special_name">Economists</em> who
	do not consider individual happiness
	as the primary object of their calculations.
	Nor is he more sanguine
	that his work will prove agreeable
	to those <em class="special_name">Natural Philosophers</em>
	who account for phenomena by the
	operation of virtues or influences
	which have no mechanical contact;—or
	to those <em class="special_name">Metaphysicians</em> who
	conceive that truth can be exhibited
	only in the sophistical subtleties of
	the schools displayed in the mazy
	labyrinths of folios and quartos;—or
	to those <em class="special_name">Theologians</em> who maintain
	that the obligations of reason
	and morality are superseded by those
	of Faith. While, in regard to those
	<a class="pagenum" id="pagevii" title="vii"> </a><em class="special_name">Topographers</em> and <em class="special_name">Antiquaries</em>
	whose studies are bounded by dates
	of erection, catalogues of occupants,
	and copies of tomb-stones;—to those
	<em class="special_name">Naturalists</em> who receive delight
	from enumerations of Linnæan
	names of herbs, shrubs, and trees,
	and from Wernerian descriptions of
	rocks;—to those <em class="special_name">Bibliomaniacs</em>
	who value a book in the inverse
	ratio of the information it contains;—and
	to those <em class="special_name">learned Philologists</em>
	who see no beauties in modern
	tongues, and affect to find (<em>but
	without anticipating any of them</em>,)
	all modern discoveries of Natural
	Philosophy in Homer, and all improvements
	of mental Philosophy in
	the mysteries of Plato—the author
	deeply laments his utter inability
	to accommodate either his taste,
	his feelings, or his conclusions.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="pageviii" title="viii"> </a>In regard to the spirit, tone, and
	character of the author’s opinions,
	they have necessarily emanated from
	the state of knowledge, in an <ins id="fix_2" title="was ‘æra’">era</ins>
	when, at the termination of four centuries
	after the adoption of Printing,
	mankind have achieved <em>four</em> great
	objects; (1,) in the <strong class="special_emphasis">REVIVAL</strong> of
	Literature, and <strong class="special_emphasis">REGENERATION</strong> of
	Philosophy; (2,) in the <strong class="special_emphasis">EMANCIPATION</strong>
	of Christendom from the systematic
	thraldom of Popery; (3,)
	in the assertion of <strong class="special_emphasis">THE RIGHTS OF
	MAN</strong>, against overwhelming usurpations;
	and (4,) in the establishment
	of <strong class="special_emphasis">A SPIRIT OF FREE ENQUIRY</strong>,
	which constitutes the vivifying energy
	of the age in which we live,
	and promises the most important
	results in regard to the future condition
	and happiness of the human
	race.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="pageix" title="ix"> </a>The accomplishment of these
	circumstances has generated, in
	all countries, a numerous class
	of readers, among whom are
	many <em class="special_name">Professors</em>, <em class="special_name">Philosophers</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Statesmen</em>, <em class="special_name">Politicians</em>, <em class="special_name">Theologians</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Antiquaries</em>, <em class="special_name">Naturalists</em>,
	and <em class="special_name">eminent Scholars</em>; besides
	<em class="special_name">Amateurs</em> of general Literature,
	with whose taste, feelings, and
	principles, the Author of this volume
	is anxious to identify his own, and
	whose favourable opinion he is ambitious
	to enjoy;—these are the
	free and honest searchers after
	<strong class="special_emphasis">MORAL</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">POLITICAL</strong>, and <strong class="special_emphasis">NATURAL
	TRUTH</strong>,—the votaries of <strong class="special_emphasis">COMMON
	SENSE</strong>,—the patients of their <strong class="special_emphasis">NATURAL
	SENSIBILITIES</strong>,—all, who are
	neither <strong class="special_emphasis">TOO OLD</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">TOO POWERFUL</strong>, nor
	<strong class="special_emphasis">TOO WISE</strong>,—and, finally, all those
	<strong class="special_emphasis">WHO PASS THEIR LIVES IN SEARCH
	<a class="pagenum" id="pagex" title="x"> </a>OF HAPPINESS</strong>, and who are not
	unwilling to be pleased, in whatsoever
	form, or by whomsoever the
	attempt may be made:</p>

	<p class="author_note">⁂ To guard the work against some apparent
	anachronisms, it is proper to state, that the
	substance of the following Pages appeared in
	various Numbers of the Monthly Magazine, between
	the Years 1813 and 1816. In reprinting,
	in this form, many interpolations have been made,
	and some subjects of a temporary nature have been
	omitted: but it was often impossible, in treating
	of local situations, to avoid some reference to
	temporary circumstances.</p>
</div>

<div id="essay"><a class="pagenum disguise" id="page1" title="1"> </a>
	<p class="internal_title">A<br />
	MORNING’S WALK<br />
	FROM<br />
	LONDON TO KEW.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">We</span> roam into unhealthy climates, and encounter
	difficulties and dangers, in search
	of curiosities and knowledge, although, if
	our industry were equally exerted at home,
	we might find in the tablets of Nature
	and Art, within our daily reach, inexhaustible
	sources of inquiry and contemplation.
	We are on every side surrounded by interesting
	objects; but, in nature, as in morals,
	we are apt to contemn self-knowledge, to
	look abroad rather than at home, and to
	study others instead of ourselves. Like
	the French Encyclopædists, we forget our
	own Paris; or, like editors of newspapers,
	we seek for novelties in every quarter of
	the world, losing sight of the superior interests
	of our immediate vicinity.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>These observations may perhaps serve
	as a sufficient apology for the narrative
	which follows:—existing notions, the love
	of the sublime, and the predilections above
	described, render it necessary for a <em>home</em>
	tourist to present himself before the public
	with modesty. The readers of voyages
	round the whole world, and of travels into
	unexplored regions of Africa and America,
	will scarcely be persuaded to tolerate a
	narrative of an excursion which began at
	nine in the morning and ended at six in
	the afternoon of the same day! Yet such,
	truly, are the <em>Travels</em> which afford the
	materials of the present narrative; they
	were excited by a fine morning in the latter
	days of April, and their scene was the
	high-road lying between <em class="special_name">London</em> and
	<em class="special_name">Kew</em>, on the banks of the Thames.</p>

	<p>With no guide besides a map of the
	country round the metropolis, and no settled
	purpose beyond what the weather
	might govern, I strolled towards St.
	James’s Park. In proceeding between the
	walls from Spring Gardens, I found the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>lame and the blind taking their periodical
	stations on each side of the passage.—I
	paused a few minutes to see them approach
	one after another as to a regular calling;
	or as players to take their stations and
	<em>enact</em> their settled parts in this drama.
	One, a fellow, who had a withered leg,
	approached his post with a cheerful air;
	but he had no sooner seated himself, and
	stripped it bare, than he began such hideous
	moans as in a few minutes attracted
	several donations. Another, a blind woman,
	was brought to her post by a little
	boy, who carelessly leading her against the
	step of a door, she petulantly gave him a
	smart box of the ear, and exclaimed,
	<span class="keep_together">“D——n</span> you, you rascal, can’t you mind
	what you’re about;”—and then, leaning
	her back to the wall, in the same breath,
	she began to chaunt a <em>hymn</em>, which soon
	brought contributions from many pious passengers.</p>

	<p>The systematic movements of these people
	led me to inquire in regard to their conduct
	and policy from an adjacent shop-keeper,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>who told me, that about a dozen
	of them obtained a good living in that
	passage; that an attendance of about two
	hours per day sufficed to each of them,
	when, by an arrangement among themselves,
	they regularly succeed each other.
	He could not guess at the amounts thus
	collected, but he said, that he had once
	watched a noisy blind fellow for half an
	hour, and in that time saw thirty-four
	people give him at least as many halfpence;
	he thence, and from other observations,
	concluded that in two or three hours
	each of them collects five or six shillings!
	We cannot wonder then at the aversion
	entertained by these unhappy objects to
	the indiscriminate discipline of our common
	work-houses; nor can we blame the
	sympathy of those benevolent persons who
	contribute their mite to relieve the cries
	of distress with which they are assailed.
	But it excites our wonder and grief that
	statesmen, who have superfluous means for
	covering the country with barracks, should
	find themselves unable to establish comfortable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>asylums for all the poor who are
	incurably diseased, in which they should
	be so provided for, that it would be as
	criminal in them to ask, as in others to
	afford them, eleemosynary relief.</p>

	<p>On my entrance into the Park, I was
	amused and interested by an assemblage of
	a hundred mothers, nurses, and valetudinarians,
	accompanied by as many children,
	who are drawn together at this hour every
	fine morning by the metropolitan luxury of
	milk warm from the cow. Seats are provided,
	as well as biscuits, and other conveniences,
	and here from sun-rise till ten
	o’clock continues a <em>milk fair</em>, distinguished
	by its peculiar music in the <em>lowing</em> of cows,
	and in the discordant <em>squalling</em> of the numerous
	children. The privilege of keeping
	these cows, and of selling their milk
	on this spot, belongs to the gate-keepers
	of the Park; and it must be acknowledged
	to be a great convenience to invalids and
	children, to whom this wholesome beverage
	and its attendant walk are often prescribed.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>On the right hand stands the garden-wall of
	the puny, though costly, palace of
	the Regent, Prince of Wales. It is, however,
	fortunate, that it is not larger, if the
	expenditure of palaces, like that of private
	houses, were to keep pace with their bulk.
	The inside is adorned like the palace of
	Aladin; and a better notion of its splendour
	may be formed, by stating that it has cost
	the labours of twenty thousand men for a
	year, or of one thousand for twenty years,
	than that above a million sterling has at
	different times been expended upon the
	building and furniture. Yet, it is said that
	it forms but the eastern wing of a palace,
	which the architects of this Prince have
	projected, and that half the south side of
	Pall-Mall and considerable tracts of the
	Park will be appropriated to complete their
	plans, if approved by their royal patron.
	I am aware, that the love of shew in
	princes, and persons in authority, is often
	justified by the alledged necessity of imposing
	on the vulgar; but I doubt whether
	any species of imposition really produces
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>the effect which the pomp of power is so
	willing to ascribe to it, as an excuse for its
	own indulgences. Nor ought it ever to
	be forgotten, that no tinsel of gaudy trappings,
	no architectural arrangements of
	stone or wood, no bands of liveried slaves,
	(however glossed in various hues, or disguised
	by various names,) can sustain the
	glory of any power which despises public
	opinion, forgets the compact between all
	power and the people, violates the faith of
	public treaties, and measures its moral obligations,
	not by the sense of justice, but
	by considerations of expediency and self-interest!
	On this important, though almost
	exhausted, topic, it should be known by
	all Princes who covet true glory, that
	<em class="special_name">Washington the Great</em> hired no
	armed men to sustain his power, that his
	habits were in all things those of a private
	citizen, and that he kept but one coach,
	merely for occasions of state—his personal
	virtues being his body-guards—the justice
	of his measures constituting the strength
	of his government,—the renown of his past
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>deeds enshrining him with more splendour
	than could be conferred by the orders of
	all the courts in Europe—his unquestionable
	love of public liberty endearing him
	to the people over whom he presided—and
	the pure flame of his patriotism causing
	him to appear in their eyes as a being
	more than mortal! Britain might envy
	America her <em class="special_name">Washington</em>, if she could
	not herself boast of <em class="special_name">an Alfred</em>, worthy
	also of being called <em class="special_name">the Great</em>—a sovereign
	who voluntarily conceded liberty to
	his people, and founded it on bases which
	all the inglorious artifices of his successors
	have been unable to undermine—but,
	alas! such men, like Epic poets, seem
	destined to succeed but once in a thousand
	years!</p>

	<p>On the left hand I beheld, in various
	magnificent erections, the germs of innumerable
	associations, gratifying to the
	vice of national pride; but affording little
	pleasure to one whose prejudices of principle,
	and habits of thinking, have taught
	him to estimate all human labours by their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>influence on the happiness of the sentient
	creatures to whom the earth is a common
	inheritance. There was <em class="special_name">the British
	Admiralty</em>—the just pride of a people’s
	defence against foreign invaders—but less
	worthy of admiration, if ever used as an
	instrument of ambition, or as a means of
	gratifying base passions. There was the
	<em class="special_name">British War-Office</em>, of which a Briton
	can say little, who doubts the policy of the
	colonial system, who feels a conviction
	that “Britain’s best bulwarks are her
	wooden walls,” and who thinks that the
	sword should never be wielded but by citizen
	soldiers, nor ever be used till the constable’s
	staff has been exerted in vain.
	And there was <em class="special_name">the British Treasury</em>,
	the talisman of whose power has destroyed
	the efficacy of title-deeds, and converted
	the land and houses of the empire into
	paper-money and stock-debts, for the purpose
	of carrying on wars and performing
	deeds, which impartial history will justly
	characterize, when alas! the truth will be
	useless to the suffering victims!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>Just at this moment I beheld several
	bands of armed men, disguised in showy
	liveries, drawn up in array to exercise
	themselves for combat. But, having no
	taste for such mistakes of power, and being
	in no degree deluded by the gloss of their
	clothes, the glitter of their murderous
	weapons, or the abuse of celestial harmony
	in the skill of their musicians, I
	silently invoked the energies of truth to
	remove from the understandings of men,
	that cloud which permits such illusions to be
	successful. No legitimate power, like that
	of the government of England, founded on
	such bases as Magna Charta, the laws of
	Edward the First, the Petition of Right, the
	Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement,
	can, for its lawful purposes, ever stand in
	need, in a properly educated community,
	of the support of a single man armed with
	a murderous weapon.</p>

	<p>These piles of buildings, ranged in a semi-circular
	form, are imposing on, the eye from
	their magnitude, and on the imagination
	from their fame. I paused to enjoy their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>perspective; but, is not senseless <strong class="special_emphasis">WAR</strong>,
	I exclaimed, even now ravaging or disturbing
	the four quarters of the world,
	and is it not from this scite that it receives
	its impulse and direction? I charitably
	hoped that mere errors of judgment had
	guided the councils of the men who inhabit
	these buildings—but I sickened as I
	thought of the consequences of their
	errors, perhaps at that moment displayed
	in distant parts of the earth in agonies of
	despair and in smoking ruins—and, to
	avoid the succession of feelings which
	were so painful, yet so unavailing, I
	turned away from the spot.</p>

	<p>In my way towards and along the Mall,
	I remarked that few were walking in my
	direction; but that all the faces and foot-steps
	were earnestly directed towards London.
	The circumstance exemplified that
	feature of modern manners which leads
	thousands of those who are engaged in the
	active business of the metropolis to sleep,
	and to keep their families, in neighbouring
	villages. These thousands walk or ride,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>therefore, every day to and from London,
	at hours corresponding with the nature
	and urgency of their employments. Before
	nine o’clock the various roads are
	covered with clerks of the public offices,
	and with bankers’ and merchants’ clerks,
	who are obliged to be at their posts at
	that hour, all exhibiting in their demeanor
	the ease of their hearts. From nine till
	eleven, you see shop-keepers, stock-brokers,
	lawyers, and principals in various
	establishments, bustling along with careful
	and anxious countenances, indicative of
	their various prospects and responsibilities.
	At twelve, saunters forth the man of wealth
	and ease, going to look at his balances,
	orders, or remittances; or merely to read
	the papers and hear the news; yet demonstrating
	the folly of wealth by his gouty legs,
	or cautious rheumatic step. Such is the
	routine of the Park, along which no carriages
	are allowed to pass; but other
	avenues into the metropolis present,
	through every forenoon, besides lines of
	pedestrians, crowded stage-coaches, private
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>coaches, and chariots, numerous gigs
	and chaises, and many equestrians.</p>

	<p>I amused myself with a calculation of
	the probable number of persons who thus
	every day, between eight and six, pass to
	and from London within a distance of
	seven miles. In the present route I concluded
	the numbers to be something like
	the following, 200 from Pimlico, 300 from
	Chelsea, 200 from the King’s Road and
	Sloane Street, 50 from Fulham and Putney,
	and 50 from Battersea and Wandsworth;
	making 800 per day. If then, there
	are twenty such avenues to the metropolis,
	it appears that the total of the regular ingress
	and egress will be 16,000 persons, of
	whom perhaps 8,000 walk, 2,000 arrive
	in public conveyances, and 6,000 ride on
	horseback, or in open or close carriages.
	Such a phenomenon is presented no-where
	else in the world; and it never can exist
	except in a city which unites the same
	combined features of population, wealth,
	commerce, and the varied employments
	which belong to our own vast metropolis.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>I observed with concern that this Park
	presents a neglected appearance. The
	seats are old and without paint, and
	many vacancies exist in the lines of the
	trees. The wooden railing round the centre
	is heavy and decayed, and the appearance
	of every part is unworthy of a metropolitan
	royal domain, adjoining the constant
	residence of the court. I was also struck
	with the aspect of St. James’s Palace in
	ruins! A private dwelling after a fire would
	have been restored in a few weeks or
	months; but the nominal palace of the
	four preceding sovereigns of England,
	the last of the Stuarts and three first
	of the Guelphs, and the scene of their
	chief grandeur, presents even to the contemporary
	generation a monument of the
	instability of every human work. The
	door at which Margaret Nicholson made
	her attempt on the life of George the
	Third, and at which the people were used
	to see that monarch enter and depart for
	many years past, is now a chaos of ruins;
	as is that entire suite of apartments which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>led to those drawing-rooms in which the
	Court was accustomed to assemble, till
	within these five years, on birth and gala
	days!—He would have been deemed a
	false and malignant prophet, who seven
	years ago might have foretold that the public
	Palace of the Kings of England would
	so soon become a heap of unrepaired ruins,
	and its splendid chambers “the habitation
	of the fowls of the air.” Yet, such has
	been the fact, in regard to the eastern
	apartments of this famous Palace!</p>

	<p>My spirits sunk, and a tear started
	into my eyes, as I brought to mind those
	crowds of beauty, rank, and fashion,
	which, till within these few years, used to
	be displayed in the centre Mall of this
	Park on Sunday evenings during the spring
	and Summer. How often in my youth had
	I been a delighted spectator of the enchanted
	and enchanting assemblage! Here
	used to promenade, for one or two hours
	after dinner, the whole British world of
	gaiety, beauty, and splendour! Here could
	be seen in one moving mass, extending the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>whole length of the Mall, five thousand of
	the most lovely women, in this country of
	female beauty, all splendidly attired, and
	accompanied by as many well-dressed men!
	What a change, I exclaimed, has a few
	years wrought in these once happy and
	cheerful personages!—How many of those
	who on this very spot then delighted my
	eyes are now mouldering in the silent
	grave!—And how altered are all their
	persons, and perhaps their fortunes and
	feelings! Alas, that gay and fascinating
	scene no longer continues, and its very
	existence is already forgotten by the new
	generation! A change of manners has put
	an end to this unparalleled assemblage, to
	this first of metropolitan pleasures, though
	of itself it was worth any sacrifice. The
	dinner hour of four and five, among the
	great, or would-be great, having shifted to
	the unhealthy hours of eight or nine, the
	promenade after dinner, in the dinner full-dress,
	is consequently lost. The present
	walk in the Green-Park does not possess
	therefore the attractions of high rank;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>while the morning assemblages in Hyde-Park
	and Kensington-Gardens, though gay
	and imposing, have little splendour of dress,
	and lose the effect produced by the presence
	of rank and distinguished character,
	owing to the greater part of the company
	being shut up in carriages.</p>

	<p>The modern custom of abandoning
	the metropolis for the sea-coast, or the
	country, as soon as the fine weather sets
	in, operates too as another draw-back from
	the fascination and agreeableness of our
	Sunday promenades. Ancient manners, in
	the capricious whirl of fashion, may however
	again return; and, if the dinner-hour
	should recede back to four, I trust
	the luxury and splendour of this delightful
	Mall will be restored.</p>

	<p>These Parks may be denominated the
	Lungs of the metropolis, for they are
	essential to the healthful respiration of its
	inhabitants, by contributing to their cheap
	and innocent pleasures. Under a wise
	and benevolent administration, they might
	be made to add still more to the public
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>happiness, and it would be a suitable
	homage of the government to the people,
	to render these promenades as attractive
	as possible. The two bands of the Guards
	might be allowed to play in the Malls for
	two hours every evening, between Lady-day
	and Michaelmas, and the number
	and construction of the seats might be
	increased and improved. Such measures
	would indicate, at least, a desire in the
	governors to contribute to the happiness
	of the governed, and would occasion
	the former to appear to the latter in a
	more grateful character than as mere
	assessors of taxes, and as organs of legal
	coercion.</p>

	<p>At Pimlico, the name of Stafford-Row
	reminded me of the ancient distinction of
	Tart-Hall, once the rival in size and splendour
	of its more fortunate neighbour,
	Buckingham-House, and long the depository
	of the Arundelian Tablets and
	Statues. It faced the Park, on the present
	scite of James-Street; its garden-wall
	standing where Stafford-Row is now
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>built, and the extensive livery-stables being
	once the stables of its residents.</p>

	<p>I turned aside on the left, to view the
	river Tye, or <em>Ty-bourn</em>, which runs from
	the top of Oxford-street, under May-Fair,
	across Piccadilly, south-east of Buckingham-House,
	under the pavement of Stafford-Row,
	and across Tothill-Fields, into
	the Thames. It is a fact, equally lost, that
	the creeks which run from the Thames, in
	the swamps, opposite Belgrave-Place, once
	joined the canal in St. James’s-Park, and,
	passing through White-Hall, formed, by
	their circuit, the ancient isle of St. Peter’s.
	Their course has been filled up between
	the wharf of the water-works and the end
	of the canal in St. James’s-Park; and the
	Isle of St. Peter’s is no longer to be
	traced. It is singular that such a marsh
	should have become the focus of the
	government, jurisprudence, and power,
	of this great empire! Yet, so it is, the
	offices of Government, the Houses of Parliament,
	and the Supreme Courts of Law,
	stand on the lowest ground in or near the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>metropolis; the greater part of which is
	still the swamp of Tothill and Milbank-Fields;
	and the whole is exposed to the inundations
	of land-floods or extraordinary
	tides. A moralist would say, that such
	bulwarks of a nation ought to have been
	seated on a rock—a wit would refer to
	the nature of the soil, the notorious corruptions
	of the body-politic—and a votary
	of superstition would ascribe the splendid
	fortunes of the scite to the favour of
	heaven, as announced in the vision to the
	monks who, eleven hundred years since,
	built Westminster-Abbey, in so unpromising
	a situation!</p>

	<p>The wall of what are called the Gardens
	of Buckingham House, form one side of
	the main street of Pimlico; but these gardens
	consist merely of a gravel walk,
	shaded by trees, with a spacious and unadorned
	area in the centre. The whole,
	is the property of Queen Charlotte, and
	is inaccessible to a visit of mere curiosity.</p>

	<p>The water-works, to the left of the road,
	supply Pimlico and part of Westminster
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>with water, and, I may add, with smoke,
	of which it emits large volumes, though
	there are so many contrivances for consuming
	it. It consists simply of a steam
	and forcing engine, not remarkable for
	novelty or ingenuity of construction. Opposite
	stands the manufactory of the ingenious
	<em class="special_name">Bramah</em>, whose locks baffle knavery,
	and whose condensing engines promise
	such important results to philosophy and
	the mechanic arts. Belgrave-Place, lower
	and upper, proves the avidity of building-speculations,
	which could thus challenge
	the prejudices against the opposite marshes.
	But I was assured by a resident of twenty
	years, that he and his family had enjoyed uninterrupted
	health in Upper Belgrave-Place,
	and that such was the general experience.</p>

	<p>On entering Chelsea, I was naturally
	led to inquire for the scite of the once gay
	Ranelagh! I passed up the avenue of
	trees, which I remember often to have
	seen blocked up with carriages. At its extremity,
	I looked for the Rotunda and its
	surrounding buildings; but, as I could not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>see them, I concluded, that I had acquired
	but an imperfect idea of the place, in my
	nocturnal visits! I went forward, on an
	open space, but still could discern no
	Ranelagh! At length, on a spot covered
	with nettles, thistles, and other rank weeds,
	I met a working man, who, in answer to
	my inquiries, told me, that he saw I
	was a stranger, or I should have known
	that Ranelagh had been pulled down, and
	that I was then standing on the scite of the
	Rotunda!</p>

	<p>Reader, imagine my feelings, for I cannot
	analyze them! This vile place, I
	exclaimed, the scite of the once-enchanting
	Ranelagh!—It cannot be—the same
	eyes were never destined to see such a
	metamorphosis! All was desolation!—A
	few inequalities appeared in the ground,
	indicative of some former building, and
	holes filled with muddy water shewed the
	foundation walls—but the rest of the space,
	making about two acres, was covered with
	clusters of tall nettles, thistles, and docks!</p>

	<p>On a more accurate survey, I traced the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>circular foundation of the Rotunda, and
	at some distance discovered the broken
	arches of some cellars, once filled with the
	choicest wines, but now with dirty water!
	Further on were marks against a garden
	wall, indicating, that the water-boilers for
	tea and coffee had once been heated there!
	I traced too the scite of the orchestra,
	where I had often been ravished by the
	finest performances of vocal and instrumental
	music! My imagination brought
	the objects before me; I fancied I could
	still hear an air of Mara’s; I turned my
	eye aside, and what a contrast appeared!—No
	glittering lights!—No brilliant happy
	company!—No peals of laughter from
	thronged boxes!—No chorus of a hundred
	instruments and voices!—All was
	death-like stillness! Is such, I exclaimed,
	the end of human splendour?—Yes,
	truly, all is vanity—and here is a striking
	example!—Here are ruins and desolation,
	even without antiquity! I am not mourning
	said I, over the remains of Babylon
	or Carthage—ruins sanctioned by the unsparing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>march of time!—But here it was
	all glory and splendour, even yesterday!
	Here, but seven years have flown away,
	and I was myself one of three thousand of
	the gayest mortals ever assembled, in one
	of the gayest scenes which the art of man
	could devise—aye, on this very spot—yet
	the whole is now changed into the dismal
	scene of desolation before me!—Full of
	such reflections, I cast my eyes eastward,
	when Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s
	Church presented themselves in a continued
	line—Ah! thought I, that line may
	at some distant epoch enable the curious
	antiquary to determine the scite of our
	British Daphne; but I could not avoid
	feeling, that if the pile of Ranelagh and
	its glories have so totally disappeared, in
	so short a season, no human work, even
	yonder colossal specimens of Gothic and
	Grecian art, or the great Metropolis
	itself, can be deemed a standard of locality
	for the guide of distant ages! I moved
	pensively from a spot which exciting such
	solemn and affecting emotions, had diminished
	<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>the vigour of my frame by exhausting
	my nervous energies.</p>

	<p>I soon turned the corner of a street
	which took me out of sight of the space
	on which once stood the gay Ranelagh;
	but it will be long ere I can remove from
	my heart the poignant sensations to which
	its sudden destruction had given rise.<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="I afterwards learnt..." class="fnmarker">1</a></p>

	<p>Before me appeared the shops so famed
	for <em>Chelsea buns</em>, which, for above thirty
	years, I have never passed without filling
	my pockets. In the original of these
	shops, for even of Chelsea buns there are
	counterfeits, are preserved mementos of
	domestic events, in the first half of the
	past century. The bottle-conjuror is exhibited
	in a toy of his own age; portraits
	are also displayed of Duke William and
	other noted personages; a model of a
	British soldier, in the stiff costume of
	the same age; and some grotto-works,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>serve to indicate the taste of a former
	owner, and were perhaps intended to
	rival the neighbouring exhibition at Don
	Saltero’s. These buns have afforded a
	competency, and even wealth; to four
	generations of the same family; and it is
	singular, that their delicate flavour, lightness
	and richness, have never been successfully
	imitated. The present proprietor
	told me, with exultation, that George
	the Second had often been a customer of
	the shop; that the present King, when
	Prince George, and often during his reign,
	had stopped and purchased his buns;
	and that the Queen, and all the Princes
	and Princesses, had been among his occasional
	customers.</p>

	<p>A little further to the west, is a vulgar
	sign of <em>Nell Gwyn</em>, to whose female sensibility,
	and influence on royalty, are ascribed
	the foundation of the adjoining
	hospital for invalid soldiers. If the mistresses
	of Princes always made a similar
	use of their ascendency, and were to teach
	their royal lovers to respect the duties of
	humanity, and build hospitals for the victims
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>of their idiotic ambition, the world
	would complain less of their extravagancies
	and vices. The excellent hearts of women
	might warrant such an expectation; but,
	unhappily, this depraved portion of the sex
	generally part with their feminine sensibilities,
	at the same time that they part with
	their character and modesty. Contemned,
	despised, or neglected by the world,
	they become haters of their species, and
	too commonly make use of their power,
	to avenge on society the personal affronts
	which they are compelled to endure.</p>

	<p>The approach to the hospital was indicated
	by the appearance of numbers of mutilated
	soldiers. It afflicted me, to see young
	men of two or three and twenty, some of
	whom had lost both their arms, and others
	both their legs! I learnt, on enquiry, that
	a few living objects of this description are
	all that now remain of regiments of their
	comrades! The rest had been killed in
	battle, or had died of fatigue, or camp diseases!
	The querulous <em>why</em>, and <em>for what</em>,
	still crossed my imagination; but I again
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>referred such busy doubts to ministers!
	I <em>may</em> be wrong; they <em>cannot</em> be wrong!
	No! they <em>must</em> be right, or such things
	would not be. I confess, notwithstanding,
	that it deeply afflicts me that such things
	<em>are</em>; yet how is the play of human passions
	to be avoided, and how are the mischiefs of
	<em>living</em> errors to be corrected? Words,
	arguments, morality, and religion, at the
	commencement of a quarrel, are exerted
	in vain—the storm of bad passions carries,
	for a season, all before it—and after mischiefs
	are irretrievably perpetrated, reason
	and experience produce repentance, when,
	alas, it is useless! Princes and statesmen
	are too proud and powerful to permit
	themselves to be instructed, or I would
	advise them on such occasions to <em>doubt</em>
	their imaginary infallibility. Let them
	solemnly <em>doubt</em> whenever some mischief,
	which they cannot repair, must be the consequence
	of their decision; and when that
	decision may, <em>perchance</em>, arise from some
	mistake! But I fear this just maxim of Philosophy
	will never become a practical rule
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>of policy strong enough to counteract the
	benefits of extended patronage enjoyed
	during wars by corrupt ministers; to allay
	the puerile love of glory cherished by
	weak princes; or to subdue the demoniacal
	passions and irrational prejudices
	artfully excited by rulers, and too often
	cherished by infatuated nations.</p>

	<p>I accosted a young man, who had lost
	both arms, and was walking pensively
	between the trees. After some expressions
	of heart-felt commisseration, I enquired by
	what mischance he had met with so
	untoward a wound? He told me that
	he was in the act of loading his musket,
	when a cannon-ball, passing before him,
	carried off one arm above the elbow,
	and so shattered the other, that it was
	necessary to amputate it. He then
	named some paltry battle where this accident
	befel him; the issue of which to
	either of the contending parties was, as I
	recollected, not worth the joint of a little
	finger, even if the entire object of the
	campaign, or war, was worth so much!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>But, said I, you are of course well provided
	for in the hospital—“No, (he replied,)
	there is not room for me at present;
	but, owing to the severity of my wounds, I
	have a double allowance as an out-pensioner—yet,
	(he modestly remarked,) it
	may easily be supposed that even a double
	allowance is not enough for a man who
	cannot help himself in any thing—I cannot
	dress myself, nor even eat or drink, but
	am obliged to be fed like a child; I have
	a poor old mother who does her best for
	me, or”——here the young man’s voice
	faultered, and some tears hung on his
	cheeks—for, alas, even these he could
	neither wipe away nor conceal! Parched
	must have been the eye that would not
	mingle tears with those of this poor fellow,
	on hearing the tale of his unchangeable
	fate! I found too that my own utterance
	sympathized with his—but, shewing him a
	shilling—and indicating, by signs, the difficulty
	I felt in putting him in possession of
	it—“here sir,” said he, “and God bless
	you;” then, stooping with his mouth, I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>put it between his lips!—Ah, thought I,
	as I turned from this wretched object, the
	most hard-hearted of those who were concerned
	in breaking public treaties, and
	rejecting overtures for peace, would have
	relented, if with my feelings they had
	beheld this single victim of the millions
	that have been imolated, to the calculations
	of their fallible policy.</p>

	<p>I now enquired for veterans—for Fontenoy
	men—Culloden men—Minden men—Quebec
	men! To some of the two last
	I was introduced; but I found them
	blind, deaf, maimed, and childish! What
	a sickening picture of human nature,
	whether we consider the causes, objects,
	or consequences! Among these hoary
	and crippled heroes, I was introduced
	to one who is now in his hundred and
	first year! His name is Ardenfair, and
	he is a native of Dorsetshire. He entered
	into the Marines about the year
	1744; was in Anson’s action, in 1747;
	and in Hawke’s, in 1759. This veteran
	sees, talks, hears, and remembers
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>well; and it is remarkable, that he performs
	the daily drudgery of sweeping the
	gravel-walks, and wheeling water in a barrow!
	One wonders at the ability to perform
	such labour, in a Centenarian; that
	such a one should be allowed to be the
	sweeper of the hospital; and still more,
	that his age had not recommended him to
	the special bounty of the officers. It
	might be expected, that the successive
	<em>fathers</em> of these invalids would, at all
	times, be exempted from ordinary duties,
	and receive some additional means of
	cheering their extension of life, so long
	beyond the ordinary duration.</p>

	<p>On the north-east border of this hospital,
	I was shewn a new erection, nearly
	of the same size, devoted to the education
	of the children of soldiers. It is, I
	am told, a very interesting establishment
	to those who view with complacency the
	favourite system of Germanizing the English
	people—but how inadequate are all
	such institutions, to repay the obligations
	of any government to its invalided soldiers,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>if ambition, prejudice, or a love of false
	glory, may, on light grounds, cover the
	earth with bleeding and mangled victims!
	As each of the veterans in such hospitals
	is often the solitary survivor of a thousand,
	of whom the complement have fallen premature
	victims of the cruel accidents of
	war, the authors ought not to conclude
	that they atone for their crimes by lodging,
	feeding, and cloathing the thousandth man,
	when he is no longer able to serve their
	purposes!</p>

	<p>Mankind are, however, so selfish, that
	nothing but the experience or the imminent
	danger of great sufferings seems likely
	to correct the errors of governments and the
	infatuations of people on the subject of
	war. The best security of peace is, consequently,
	the danger that the chances of war
	may bring its scourges home to the fire-sides
	of either of the belligerents. The
	fears of nations have, therefore, taught
	them the duty of doing to each other as
	they would be done unto. It forms, however,
	a new epoch in the history of society,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>that, owing to their insular situation, the
	passions of one great people are unchecked
	by this salutary fear; and public morality,
	in consequence, has stood in need of some
	new stimulus, to relieve the world from the
	danger of suffering interminable slaughters.
	What a <strong class="special_emphasis">TEST</strong> this new situation afforded to
	the powers of <em class="special_name">Christianity</em>! But for
	twenty years, alas, Christianity has <strong class="special_emphasis">TOTALLY
	FAILED</strong>, and pretended zealots of
	the religion of peace and charity have been
	even among the most furious abettors of
	implacable war!</p>

	<p>Opposite the superb terrace of the
	Hospital gardens, stands a tea-drinking
	house, called <em>the Red House</em>; and about
	fifty yards on the western side of it is
	the place at which Cæsar crossed the
	Thames. The reader who has read Stukeley’s
	reasons for fixing on Chertsey as the
	place of this celebrated passage, may startle
	at the positive affirmation here made.
	Stukeley says that the name of Chertsey
	is all Cæsar; so also is Chelsea, by analogies
	equally natural. London, or Lyn-dyn,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>was then the chief town in South Britain,
	and would, as matter of course, be the
	place towards which the Britons would retreat
	and the Romans advance. Landing
	near Deal, they would cross the
	river at the ford nearest their place of
	landing, and would not be likely to march
	to Chertsey, if they could cross at Chelsea;
	and the marshes of the Thames, to which
	the Britons retreated, would correspond
	better with the marshes of Lambeth and
	Battersea than with the low lands near
	Chertsey, where the river is inconsiderable,
	and where there is no tide to confer
	strength and military character on the
	marshes. This ford, from the Red House
	to the Bank, near the scite of Ranelagh,
	still remains; and I have surveyed it more
	than once. At ordinary low water, a shoal
	of gravel, not three feet deep, and broad
	enough for ten men to walk abreast, extends
	across the river, except on the Surrey
	side, where it has been deepened by
	raising ballast. Indeed, the causeway from
	the south bank may yet be traced at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>low water; so that this was doubtless a
	ford to the peaceful Britons, across which
	the British army retreated before the Romans,
	and across which they were doubtless
	followed by Cæsar and the Roman
	legions. The event was pregnant with
	such consequences to the fortunes of these
	islands, that the spot deserves the record
	of a monument, which ought to be preserved
	from age to age, as long as the veneration
	due to antiquity is cherished
	among us. Who could then have contemplated
	that the folly of Roman ambition
	would be the means of introducing arts
	among the semi-barbarous Britons, which,
	in eighteen hundred and forty years, or
	after the lapse of nearly sixty generations,
	would qualify Britain to become mistress
	of Imperial Rome; while one country
	would become so exalted, and the other be
	so debased, that the event would excite little
	attention, and be deemed but of secondary
	importance? Possibly after another sixty
	generations, the posterity of the savage
	tribes near Sierra Leone, or New Holland,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>may arbitrate the fate of London, or of
	Britain, as an affair of equal indifference!</p>

	<p>I passed a few minutes in the famous
	Botanic Garden of the Apothecaries’
	Company, founded at Chelsea by <em class="special_name">Sir
	Hans Sloane</em>. It was the first establishment
	of the kind in England, but
	has now for some years been superseded
	in fame and variety by the Royal Gardens
	at Kew. It still however merits notice,
	as containing specimens of all the plants
	recognized in the <em>Materia Medica</em>, and
	with that view is maintained, at a heavy
	expence to the company, for the use of
	medical students. The company’s Professor
	of Botany annually gives lectures
	at this institution to the apprentices of the
	members, and accompanies them in <em>simpling</em>
	excursions in the country round the
	metropolis. The statue of the public spirited
	founder still adorns the garden; and
	the famous cedars of Lebanon add an
	air of solemn grandeur to the whole, which
	could be conferred by no other objects
	of nature or art. The conservatories are on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>a grand scale; and so many interesting
	exotics claimed my notice, that I could
	have passed a week or a month in contemplating
	them.</p>

	<p>In Cheyne Walk, facing the Thames,
	I sought for the Museum and Coffee-house
	of Don Saltero, renowned in the
	swimming exploits of Franklin. Here stands
	the same house, and it is still a place of
	entertainment; but, about ten years ago,
	the lease expired, when the rarities, presented
	by so many collectors, to the spirited
	Barber Salter, (nicknamed, Don Saltero,)
	were sold by public auction.</p>

	<p>A little farther stands the ancient and
	unostentatious palace of the Bishops of
	Winchester, and here has resided the venerable
	Brownlow North, during the thirty-three
	years that he has filled that wealthy
	see; and, a hundred yards to the west, I surveyed,
	with becoming interest, the decayed
	premises, now a paper-hanging manufactory,
	which once was the residence of
	the witty Sir Thomas More, and where, as
	it is recorded, he entertained Erasmus. I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>was, therefore, on classic ground; though
	Faulkner, in his amusing History of Chelsea,
	ascribes the residence of the Chancellor
	to another situation. The men who
	adorned the era of the revival of learning,
	and, as its patrons, furnished us with weapons
	by which to deprive imposition of its
	powers, are well entitled to our esteem; but
	many of them were entangled in the bridle,
	by whose means more crafty persons had
	long rode on the backs of mankind. Thus
	the friendship and intercourse of sir Thomas
	More and Erasmus were founded on their
	mutual zeal in behalf of those ecclesiastical
	frauds which for so many ages had subdued
	every scintillation of reason. They
	were, in their days, among the adherents of
	Popish superstition, what Symmachus had
	been to the Roman polytheists in the age
	of Theodosius—what Peter the Hermit
	was to the fanatics of the darker ages—and
	what Burke was to the bigotted politicians
	at the dawn of liberty in France.
	Erasmus, it is true, exposed, with great
	ability much priestcraft and statecraft, yet
	his learning and labours were, for the chief
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>part, devoted to the support of certain irrational
	points of theological faith; and
	poor Sir Thomas More lost his head on the
	scaffold rather than aid his less fastidious
	sovereign in overturning the spiritual supremacy
	of the bishops of Rome. We
	may honour the conscientious scruples of
	such men; but, enabled, as we now are, to
	view their errors at a proper focal distance,
	we are warranted, by their example, in
	drawing the inference that the highest human
	authorities are no tests of truth, and
	that great energies of intellect often serve
	but to strengthen prejudices, and give mischievous
	force to aberrations of reason.</p>

	<p>The tomb of Sir Hans Sloane caught my
	eye as I passed the corner of the church-yard,
	but not in so good a condition as
	the improved value of his estates might
	warrant one to expect. It is surmounted
	by the mystic symbols of the <em>egg</em> and <em>serpent</em>,
	in a good style of sculpture. Part
	of the church is precisely what it was
	when the Chancellor More regularly
	formed part of its congregation.</p>

	<p>In crossing the bridge to Battersea, I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>was called upon to pay toll, and was informed,
	that this bridge is <em>private</em> property.—A
	bridge across a great river, in a <em>civilized</em>
	country, <em>private</em> property!—Is not
	this monstrous, thought I, in a country in
	which seventy millions of taxes are collected
	per annum, and which has accumulated
	a debt of nine hundred millions
	since the accession of the house of Guelph?
	Yet, if bridges remain private property,
	<strong class="special_emphasis">FOR WHAT BENEFIT</strong> has so much money
	been expended? Have bridges, or
	hospitals, or schools, or houses for the
	poor, been built with the money?—It
	seems not!—Have roads been made—canals
	cut—rivers widened—harbours improved?—No,
	these are private and interested
	speculations! What then, I exclaimed,
	has been done with it?</p>

	<p>If this bridge cost twenty thousand
	pounds, one million of the nine hundred
	would have built fifty such bridges!—Yet,
	the war in the Peninsula, for the purpose
	of setting up the bigotted Ferdinand in
	place of the liberal Joseph, costs the
	country three millions per month; or as
	<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>much as would build a hundred and
	fifty fine bridges over the principal rivers
	of the empire! Another three millions
	would build a hundred and fifty
	great public hospitals for the incurable
	poor! A third such sum would make fifty
	thousand miles of good roads! And a
	fourth would construct three thousand
	miles of canal, or ten or twelve such as
	the Grand Junction Canal! That is to
	say, all these <em>substantial</em> benefits might
	be produced to the country by a few weeks’
	cost of the war in the Peninsula; a war
	of such doubtful benefit, either to England,
	to Spain, or to humanity!</p>

	<p>At the distance of a hundred yards from
	Battersea Bridge, an extensive pile of
	massy brickwork, for the manufactory of
	Soap, has recently been erected, at a cost,
	it is said, of sixty thousand pounds. I
	was told it was inaccessible to strangers,
	and therefore was obliged to content myself
	with viewing it at a distance. Such
	vast piles are not uncommon in and near
	London; yet how great and certain must
	be the profits of a commodity to warrant
	<a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>the expenditure of such large capitals before
	there can be any return! It might
	seem too that a man possessed of sixty
	thousand pounds, or of as much as, at
	the present value of money, would purchase
	for ever the constant labour of from
	above sixty to eighty men, would have
	avoided the hazards of trade.—Yet in
	England it is not so—the avaricious spirit
	of commerce despises all mediocrity—care
	is preferred to enjoyment—and the ends
	of life are sacrificed to the means! It has
	always been the foible of man not to be
	contented with the good he possesses, but
	to look forward to happiness in the anticipation
	of something which he hopes to
	attain. Thus, few congratulate themselves
	on the comforts they enjoy, or consider the
	consequences of losing them; but, neglectful
	of blessings in hand, rush forward
	in quest of others which they may never be
	able to obtain, and which, when possessed,
	are again as little enjoyed.</p>

	<p>Poets, divines, and moralists, have asserted
	this important truth in all ages;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>but have failed to cure the delusion,
	though it is at once the cause of the greater
	part of the miseries of individuals, and
	of the mischievous errors of governments.
	Moses guarded against it by new subdivisions
	of property in every year of jubilee;
	but the fraternal regulations of the family
	of Abraham are not conceived to be applicable
	to the whole family of man, as
	blended in modern nations; and statesmen
	and economists now think it better that
	endless competitions should be encouraged,
	and indefinite accumulations tolerated,
	than that industry should be checked by
	any regard to the personal happiness which
	might result from moderated and bounded
	wealth. Hence, he that has health and
	strength to labour for his own subsistence
	is not contented unless he can accumulate
	enough to purchase the labour of others—and
	he who has enough to purchase the
	labours of fifty, is miserable if another can
	purchase the labours of sixty—while he
	who can purchase the labours of a thousand
	is still wretched if some other can purchase
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>the labours of two thousand. In the
	wilds of Africa and America, men suffer
	every species of misery for want of the
	impulse created by the reward of labour;
	whereas the suffering is little less, though
	varied in kind, from the gradations created
	in long-established societies by the insatiable
	cravings of avarice! I am aware
	that it is hazardous to discuss a subject
	which probes to the quick the sensibility
	of pride; yet this is a social problem which
	merits the consideration of all statesmen
	who are anxious to promote the happiness
	of communities; and it ought not to be
	lost sight of by any future Solon who may
	be called upon to ameliorate the condition
	of his country.</p>

	<p>At a few yards from the toll-gate of
	the bridge, on the Western side of the
	road, stand the work-shops of that eminent,
	modest, and persevering mechanic,
	Mr. <em class="special_name">Brunel</em>; a gentleman of the rarest
	genius, who has effected as much for the
	Mechanic Arts as any man of his time.
	The wonderful apparatus in the dock-yard
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>at Portsmouth, by which he cuts blocks
	for the navy, with a precision and expedition
	that astonish every beholder, secures
	him a monument of fame, and eclipses
	all rivalry. In a small building on the left,
	I was attracted by the solemn action of a
	steam-engine of a sixteen-horse or eighty-men
	power, and was ushered into a room,
	where it turned, by means of bands, four
	wheels fringed with fine saws, two of
	eighteen feet in diameter, and two of them
	nine feet. These circular saws were used
	for the purpose of separating veneers, and
	a more perfect operation was never performed.
	I beheld planks of mahogany
	and rose-wood sawed into veneers the sixteenth
	of an inch thick, with a precision
	and grandeur of action which really was
	sublime! The same power at once turned
	these tremendous saws, and drew their
	work upon them. A large sheet of veneer,
	nine or ten feet long by two feet
	broad, was thus separated in about ten
	minutes, so even, and so uniform, that it
	appeared more like a perfect work of Nature
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>than one of human art! The force
	of these saws may be conceived when it
	is known that the large ones revolve sixty-five
	times in a minute; hence, 18 × 3,14 =
	56,5 × 65 gives 3672 feet, or two-thirds
	of a mile in a minute; whereas, if a sawyer’s
	tool give thirty strokes of three feet
	in a minute, it is but ninety feet, or only
	the fortieth part of the steady force of
	Mr. Brunel’s saws!</p>

	<p>In another building, I was shewn his
	manufactory of shoes, which, like the other,
	is full of ingenuity, and, in regard to
	subdivision of labour, brings this fabric on
	a level with the oft-admired manufactory
	of pins. Every step in it is effected by
	the most elegant and precise machinery;
	while as each operation is performed by
	one hand, so each shoe passes through
	twenty-five hands, who complete from the
	hide, as supplied by the currier, a hundred
	pair of strong and well-finished shoes per
	day. All the details are performed by ingenious
	applications of the mechanic powers,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>and all the parts are characterized by
	precision, uniformity, and accuracy. As
	each man performs but one step in the
	process, which implies no knowledge of
	what is done by those who go before or
	follow him, so the persons employed are
	not shoemakers, but wounded soldiers,
	who are able to learn their respective duties
	in a few hours. The contract at which
	these shoes are delivered to government
	is 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pair, being at least 2<i>s.</i> less
	than what was paid previously for an unequal
	and cobbled article.</p>

	<p>While, however, we admire these triumphs
	of mechanics, and congratulate
	society on the prospect of enjoying more
	luxuries at less cost of human labour, it
	ought not to be forgotten, that the general
	good in such cases is productive of great partial
	evils, against which a paternal government
	ought to provide. No race of workmen
	being proverbially more industrious
	than shoemakers, it is altogether unreasonable,
	that so large a portion of valuable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>members of society should be injured
	by improvements which have the ultimate
	effect of benefitting the whole.</p>

	<p>The low price of labour deprives these
	classes of the power of accumulating any
	private fund, on which to subsist while they
	are learning new trades; it seems therefore
	incumbent on governments to make
	sufficient provision, from the public stock,
	for all cases of distress, which arise out of
	changes of this kind. If governments were
	benevolent, and vigilant in their benevolence,
	no members of the community
	would, under any circumstances, suffer
	from causes which are productive, or supposed
	to be productive, of general benefit.
	I qualify the position by the word <em>supposed</em>,
	because, owing to social monopolies,
	and to the advantages taken of poverty by
	the habits of wealth, the mass of the people
	are less benefited by the introduction
	of machinery than they ought to be. If a
	population have been drawn or driven from
	agriculture to manufactures, and the lands
	which maintained in humble independance
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>the ancestors of the manufacturers are, in
	consequence, united into single farms, the
	manufacturers should not be left without
	resource, if their trade fails, or their labour
	is superseded by machinery. Against the
	ill effects of such changes, paternal governments
	should provide means of relief, so
	as to render them as little prejudicial to
	individuals as possible; and no transitions
	in the productive value of various labour,
	should be allowed to destroy the industrious
	part of the population, or force them to
	seek subsistence in foreign climes. It being
	the object of all machinery to save
	human labour, of course society at large
	ought to enjoy the benefit; and all who
	are in danger of suffering for a benefit to
	be enjoyed by the whole, should be liberally
	indemnified out of the common stock.
	Nothing could be more easy than for a
	board of commissioners or arbitrators
	to assess on the public such individual
	losses; and, in cases of great transitions,
	imposts should be so levied on monopoly
	as to restore the equilibrium of great
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>branches of industry. For what but for
	such purposes of equalizing happiness are
	governments constituted and maintained?</p>

	<p>I passed from the premises of Mr.
	Brunel, to the nearly adjoining ones of
	Mr. Hodgson, an intelligent maltster and
	distiller, and the proprietor of the elevated
	horizontal air-mill, which serves as a landmark
	for many miles round. But his mill,
	its elevated shaft, its vanes, and weather
	or wind boards, curious as they would have
	been on any other scite, lost their interest
	on premises once the residence of
	the illustrious Bolingbroke, and the resort
	of the philosophers of his day. In
	ascending the winding flights of its tottering
	galleries, I could not help wondering
	at the caprice of events which had converted
	the dwelling of Bolingbroke into
	a malting-house and a mill. This house,
	once sacred to philosophy and poetry,
	long sanctified by the residence of the
	noblest genius of his age, honoured by
	the frequent visits of Pope, and the birthplace
	of the immortal Essay on Man, is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>now appropriated to the lowest uses! The
	house of Bolingbroke become a windmill!
	The spot on which the Essay on Man
	was concocted and produced, converted
	into a distillery of pernicious spirits! Such
	are the lessons of time! Such are the
	means by which an eternal agency sets
	at nought the ephemeral importance of
	man! But yesterday, this spot was the
	resort, the hope, and the seat of enjoyment
	of Bolingbroke, Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot,
	Thomson, Mallet, and all the contemporary
	genius of England—yet a few whirls
	of the earth round the sun, the change of
	a figure in the date of the year, and the
	groupe have vanished; while in their place
	I behold hogs and horses, malt-bags and
	barrels, stills and machinery!</p>

	<p>Alas, said I, to the occupier, and have
	these things become the representatives of
	more human genius than England may
	ever witness on one spot again—have you
	thus satirized the transitory fate of humanity,—do
	you thus become a party
	with the bigotted enemies of that philosophy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>which was personified in a Bolingbroke
	and a Pope? No, he rejoined, I love
	the name and character of Bolingbroke,
	and I preserve the house as well as I can
	with religious veneration; I often smoke
	my pipe in Mr. Pope’s parlour, and think
	of him with due respect as I walk the
	part of the terrace opposite his room. He
	then conducted me to this interesting parlour,
	which is of brown polished oak, with
	a grate and ornaments of the age of
	George the First; and before its window
	stood the portion of the terrace upon
	which the malt-house had not encroached,
	with the Thames moving majestically under
	its wall. I was on holy ground!—I did
	not take off my shoes—but I doubtless felt
	what pilgrims feel as they approach the
	temples of Jerusalem, Mecca, or Jaggernaut!
	Of all poems, and of all codes of
	wisdom, I admire the Essay on Man, and
	its doctrines, the most; and in this room, I
	exclaimed, it was probably planned, discussed,
	and written!</p>

	<p>Mr. Hodgson assured me, this had always
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>been called “Pope’s room,” and he
	had no doubt it was the apartment usually
	occupied by that great poet, in his visits
	to his friend Bolingbroke. Other parts of
	the original house remain, and are occupied
	and kept in good order. He
	told me, however, that this is but a wing
	of the mansion, which extended in Lord
	Bolingbroke’s time to the church-yard, and
	is now appropriated to the malting-house
	and its warehouses.</p>

	<p>The church itself is a new and elegant
	structure, but chiefly interesting to me, as
	containing the vault of the St. John family,
	in which lies the great Lord, at
	whose elegant monument, by Roubilliac,
	I lingered some minutes.</p>

	<p>On inquiring for an ancient inhabitant
	of Battersea, I was introduced to a Mrs.
	Gilliard, a pleasant and intelligent woman,
	who told me, she well remembered Lord
	Bolingbroke; that he used to ride out
	every day in his chariot, and had a
	black patch on his cheek, with a large
	wart over his eye-brows. She was then
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>but a girl, but she was taught to look
	upon him with veneration as a great man.
	As, however, he spent little in the place,
	and gave little away, he was not much
	regarded by the people of Battersea. I
	mentioned to her the names of several of
	his contemporaries, but she recollected
	none, except that of Mallet, who, she
	said, she had often seen walking about in
	the village, while he was visiting at Bolingbroke
	House. The unassuming dwelling
	of this gentlewoman affords another
	proof of the scattered and unrecorded
	wealth of Britain, in works of superior
	art. I found in her retired parlour, a fine
	historical picture, by Vandyke, for which
	she said she had been offered 500l. but
	which she refused to part with, not less
	from a spirit of independence, than from
	a tasteful estimate of the beauties of the
	picture.</p>

	<p>It was in the warm alluvial plain adjoining
	this village, the very swamp into which
	the Britons retreated before Cæsar, that
	the first asparagus was cultivated in England.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>I could learn no particulars of
	this circumstance, but such vast quantities
	are still grown here, that one gardener has
	fifty acres engaged in the production of this
	vegetable, and there are above two hundred
	acres of it within a mile of Battersea
	church.</p>

	<p>Proceeding onward between some ancient
	walls which bound the grounds of
	various market gardeners, I was told that
	here resided the father of Queen Anne
	Boleyn; but I could not fix any thing with
	precision on the subject, though it appears
	from the monument of Queen Elizabeth,
	in Battersea church, that the Boleyns were
	related to the St. John’s.</p>

	<p>A manufacturer of pitch and turpentine
	politely shewed me over his works. I
	trembled as I passed among his combustible
	cauldrons, and not without cause,
	for the place had recently been burnt to the
	ground, and it experienced the same fate
	a second time, but a few weeks after my
	visit. May we not hope that the applicable
	powers of heated gas will enable such manufactories
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>to be carried on without the
	inevitable recurrence of such conflagrations.</p>

	<p>This walk brought me to a large
	distillery, which still bears the name of
	York House, and was a seat of the Archbishops
	of York, from the year 1480 to
	its alienation. Here resided Wolsey, as
	Archbishop of York—here Henry VIII.
	first saw Anne Boleyn—and here that
	scene took place which Shakespeare records
	in his play of Henry VIII; and
	which he described truly, because he wrote
	it for Elizabeth, the daughter of Anne
	Boleyn, within fifty years of the event,
	and must himself have known living witnesses
	of its verity. Hence it becomes
	more than probable, that Sir Thomas Boleyn
	actually resided in the vicinity, and that
	his daughter was accidentally among the
	guests at that princely entertainment. I
	know it is contended, that this interview
	took place at York House, Whitehall;
	but Shakespeare makes the King come
	by Water; and York House, Battersea,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>was beyond all doubt a residence of Wolsey,
	and is provided with a creek from
	the Thames, for the evident purpose of
	facilitating intercourse by water. Besides,
	the owner informed me, that a few years
	since he had pulled down a superb room,
	called “the ball-room,” the pannels of which
	were curiously painted, and the divisions
	silvered. He also stated that the room had
	a dome and a richly ornamented ceiling,
	and that he once saw an ancient print,
	representing the first interview of Henry
	VIII. with Anne Boleyn, in which the
	room was portrayed exactly like the one
	that, in modernizing his house, he had
	found it necessary to destroy.</p>

	<p>My polite host took me to his green-house,
	and shewed me a fine specimen
	of that wonder of the second degree of
	organized existence—an American aloe,
	about to put forth its blossoms. Its vigorous
	upright stem was twelve feet high, and
	its head promised a rich profusion of
	splendid flowers. It is indeed no fable,
	that this perennial plant grows about a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>hundred years (a few more or less,) before
	it blooms; and, after yielding its seed, the
	stem withers and dies! I could not avoid
	being struck with the lesson which this
	centenarian affords to the Pride of man,
	when, on asking its owner, how he knew
	that it was a hundred years old, he informed
	me that “it had been in his possession
	the half of his life,” that is, the mighty
	period of five-and-twenty years! “That
	it had previously been the property of the
	Hon. Mrs. ——,” whose name, in spite of
	her <em>honour</em>, is now as lost to fame as she
	herself is lost to that existence which gave
	rise to any self-importance! That he “had
	heard, that, before <em>her time</em>, it belonged
	to Lord ——,” a name which I have also
	forgotten, because it was unnecessary to
	remember it, the common-place peer having
	also exhausted the measure of his days
	since our still-flourishing aloe was in its
	dawn! “Ah, Sir,” said I, “so the aloe
	has seen out all those who vainly called
	it their property—They have been swept
	away, generation after generation, yet it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>still survives a living commentary on their
	utter insignificance; and it laughs at the
	proud assumption of those who called
	themselves its proprietors, but could not
	maintain a property in themselves! Just so
	the same creature of yesterday asserts his
	property in that ancient globe, which he is
	destined to enjoy but an hour; and he asserts,
	that all was made for him, though in
	another hour he leaves all and becomes
	again, as to the planet which nurtured
	him, the nonentity of yesterday.</p>

	<p>Pride, the bane of man—I exclaimed,
	as I passed the gate—what are its
	claims? Does it arise from fine clothing?—let
	it be remembered that every part has
	been stolen from the lowest of Nature’s
	works—that the finest glitter is but a modification
	of the very surface—and that
	the garments which this year deck beauty
	and rank, will in the next be rotting on
	the dunghill! Does Pride feed on the
	records of ancestry?—let it visit the family
	tomb, and examine the bones and
	dust of that ancestry on which it founds
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>its self-importance! Is Pride derived
	from titles of distinction?—let it inquire
	who conferred them—for what—and by
	what intrigues—and let it be considered,
	that titles or names confer no inherent
	quality, and do not alter the nature of
	any thing to which they are applied!
	Does an inexperienced girl take a lesson
	of Pride from her looking-glass?—she
	may be cured of her foible, by conceiving
	10 to be added to the date of the year,
	or by looking on those ten years older than
	herself! Is it an office of power which
	serves as the basis of a lofty and insulting
	Pride?—let him who fills it remember
	that he is but the puppet of knaves, or
	fools; and at best but a mere <em>servant</em> of
	the public! Does wealth intoxicate the
	weakness of man?—let it never be forgotten
	that the possession is distinct from the
	possessor, and that the most contemptible
	of the human race have been the accumulators
	of wealth! Does the name
	of wisdom, puff up any of its professors?—of
	such it may truly be said, that
	their wisdom is foolishness—for none truly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>wise ever felt, in the researches of man,
	any ground of arrogance, while pursuits
	of philosophy serve only to teach humility!—But
	to what purpose tend such observations?
	Every man is his own microcosm,
	and his case, in his own view, is
	that of no other man! Pride will always
	find food in self-love, which in spite of
	exhortations, it will devour with ravenous
	appetite! If men were immortal, how
	intolerable would be existence from the arrogance
	and perpetuity of Pride! While
	this passion infects and misleads the governors
	of the world, the only consolation
	in looking on weak princes, wicked
	statesmen, unfeeling lawyers, and military
	butchers, is that, in the course
	of nature, Death will soon relieve the
	world from the pest of their influence!
	And there are few men who would, not
	prefer death as their own fate, and who
	would not hail death as a common blessing,
	rather than live an eternity under the
	dominion of the weak, the crafty, or the
	cruel Proud!</p>

	<p>The road from York House towards
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>Wandsworth, lay across a Plain of unenclosed
	fields, which, before the Thames
	had carved out the boundaries of its
	course, was, I have no doubt, generally
	covered with its waters. After the ocean
	left the land, and the hills became the depositaries
	of the clouds, how many ages
	must have elapsed before the beds of
	rivers were circumscribed as we now see
	them in England. The water always followed
	the lowest level, but, being of different
	quantities at different seasons, vegetation
	would flourish on the sides occasionally
	covered, and in time would generate
	banks; while the stream itself, by carrying
	off the argillaceous bottom, would add to
	the depth—the two combined causes producing
	all the phenomena of bounded
	rivers.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="It is difficult to assign limits..." class="fnmarker">2</a> The Thames, after heavy rains,
	or thaws of snow, still overflows its banks,
	thereby adding to the vegetable productions
	of its meadows, which, if not consumed,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>or carried away by man, would,
	long ere this, have fixed unalterably the
	limits of its course. The effect of these
	inundations in our days, or in past ages,
	has been to render its banks the fertile
	scite of all those fine garden-grounds which
	supply the metropolis so abundantly with
	fruits and vegetables.</p>

	<p>Some large Distilleries, on the banks of
	the river, reminded me of the bad policy
	of governments, which, sacrificing the end
	to the means, that is, the health and
	morals of the people to purposes of revenue,
	tolerates and even encourages manufactories
	so pernicious. I am aware I
	may be answered, that the working classes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>love this poison, and must be gratified;
	and that in 1813 the duty on British
	spirits produced £1,636,504. But I reply,
	first, that it is obligatory on good
	governments to protect the people against
	the effects of their vices; and second,
	that, if the people were not indulged in
	the ruinous habit of gin-drinking, and destroyed
	by it in body and mind, they
	would be able to pay a greater sum to
	the revenue from productions of a salutary
	nature. Such are the pernicious effects
	of drunkenness, and the numerous
	miseries created by drinking fermented
	and spirituous liquors, that I have often
	been tempted to consider it as an atonement
	for the impostures of Mahomet, that
	he so forcibly prohibited the practice, and
	so far succeeded, that a rigid forbearance
	is observed by his followers, and a Musselman
	rendered <ins id="errata_1" title="was ‘beastly vicious and diseased’">beastly, vicious, and diseased,</ins>
	by habits of drunkenness is never
	seen. The doctrines of the New Testament
	and the example of the Founder of
	our religion inculcate an equal degree of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a>abstemiousness, yet how contrary are the
	practices of Christians! There seems
	indeed, in regard to this vice, to be no
	middle course. Spirituous, and perhaps
	also fermented, liquors, will be abused,
	or they must be wholly prohibited; because
	the stimulus which they create at
	one time, is sought at another, and the
	oftener it is repeated, the oftener it is
	desired and required; till at length it becomes
	necessary to the sense of well-being,
	or apparently essential to the power of
	sustaining the fatigue of life.</p>

	<p>In the middle of these fields I passed a
	handsome house, which appeared to have
	been empty for a considerable time. On
	enquiring the cause of a young woman,
	who passed at the moment; she told me,
	with an artless countenance, that “<em>it
	was haunted</em>.” I smiled, and asked how
	she knew it. “Ah, Sir,” said she, “its
	nothing to laugh at—every body here-abouts
	knows it well enough—such strange
	noises are heard in it, and such lights flit
	about it at midnight.”—Have you seen
	<a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"> </a>them? “No, Sir, but I knows those that
	have, and I’m sure its true.” Seeing a
	labouring man at a distance, I enquired
	what he knew of the haunted house, when
	he told me, with a face full of faith, that
	“he knew gentlefolks laughed at such
	things, but seeing was believing—that, passing
	the house one night, he was quite sartain
	he had seen a light in one of the rooms,
	and had heard groans—-that he got home
	as well as he could, but all the world
	should not induce him to pass the house
	again at that time of the night.” “And
	others,” said I, “have perhaps seen the
	the same?”—“Aye, by goles, have they,”
	exclaimed the fellow with terror in his
	countenance.—I then told him, I would
	with pleasure sit up in the house to see
	these ghosts—“Rather you than I, Sir,”
	said he.—“Nay, nay,” said I, “I dare
	say now for five shillings you would sit up
	with me!” “Naugh, dang me if I would,
	nor for the best five pounds in the world,
	much as I wants money! I don’t fear man,
	but I am naugh match for the devil!—I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>believes in God, and does nobody any
	harm; and therefore don’t think he’d let
	the old-one hurt me: but some main wicked
	ones lived, as I’ve hard, in that there
	house, so I’ll have naught to do with it;
	and dang me if any of ’em shall catch me
	in it after night.”</p>

	<p>The poor fellow uttered these sentiments
	with such earnestness, that my risible emotions
	were converted into pity. I forebore,
	however, to argue the point with him,
	for many instances of superstition equally
	gross had long convinced me that the untaught
	and half-taught of my countrymen
	are, in this respect, little superior to the
	savage tribes, whom we pity, in Tartary,
	Africa, and America: yet in this instance
	the man’s inference was a consequence of
	his premises, and his error in these it might
	have been deemed heretical to expose.</p>

	<p>The nursery becomes the means of fixing
	similar impressions in the families of the
	most enlightened, and the unformed minds
	of children propagate in public schools
	the stories of their nurses. The lowest
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>superstition pervades therefore all ranks,
	even of a population so comparatively
	enlightened as that of England; and,
	being imbibed in infancy and confirmed,
	through the entire period of youth, no impressions
	are more strong, or more universally
	operative. The poet and the priest
	either encourage the feeling, or do not
	take any pains to remove it. The agency
	of spirits and abstract principles, is countenanced
	by some of the records of religion,
	and by philosophers and physicians
	in their reasonings about occult causes,
	sympathies, coincidencies, and destinies.
	It is urged in vain, that ghosts and supernatural
	effects are never seen, except by the
	weakest or most ignorant of mankind, in
	ages or states of society when the people
	might be made to believe any thing; or at
	times so distant, or places so remote, that
	the narrators run no risk of detection or
	exposure. The love of the marvellous, the
	force of early impressions, the craft of many
	persons, and the folly of others, will however
	occasion every village to have its haunted
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"> </a>house for ages to come, in spite of the press,
	and of those discoveries of philosophy which
	are every day narrowing the sphere of
	miracles and prodigies.</p>

	<p>In considering this subject with the attention
	that is due to it, it has appeared
	to me that all the stories of ghosts and
	super, or, un-natural appearances, may be
	referred to some of the following causes:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>To the augmentation produced by
	fear in any effect on the senses—thus the
	ear of a terrified man will convert the
	smallest noise into the report of thunder,
	or his eye will change the stump of a tree
	into a monster twenty feet high. As the
	senses are furnished for protection, their
	irritability, under the impression of fear,
	is part of their economy, as the means of
	preserving our being; but it is absurd to
	refer back the effects thus augmented, to
	external causes which might be capable of
	producing the augmentation. To such an
	error of the senses and of reasoning, is,
	however, to be referred half the ghosts and
	supernaturals of which we hear in village
	ale-houses, in nurseries and schools.</li>

	<li><a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>To diseased organs of sensation; as
	an inflamed eye producing the effect of
	flashes of light in the dark, or fulness of
	blood producing a ringing or singing in
	the ears. Sometimes diseases of the visual
	organs are accompanied by hallucinations
	of mind; and persons ill in fevers
	often see successions of figures and objects
	flit before their eyes till the disease has
	been removed. The workings of conscience
	or nervous affections will also produce
	diseases of the senses, and such hallucinations
	of mind as to occasion a person
	to fancy he sees another, or to be
	haunted by him. But there is nothing
	supernatural in all this; it is sometimes a
	local disease, sometimes an effect of fever,
	sometimes a nervous affection, and sometimes
	partial insanity.</li>

	<li>To natural causes not understood by
	the parties. Thus, anciently the northern
	lights were mistaken for armies fighting;
	meteors and comets for flaming
	swords, portending destruction or pestilence;
	the electrified points of swords to
	the favour of heaven; the motions of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>planets to attractive effluvia; and all the
	effects of the comixture of the gases to
	benign or diabolical agency, as they happened
	to produce on the parties good or
	evil. So in the like manner old houses
	are generally said to be haunted, owing to
	the noises which arise from the cracking
	and yielding of their walls and timbers,
	and from the protection and easy passage
	which in the course of time they afford
	to rats, mice, weasels, &amp;c. whose activity
	in the night-time affords the foundation
	of numerous apprehensions and fancies
	of the credulous.</li>

	<li>To spontaneous combustions or detonations,
	which produce occasional lights
	and noises, or, under unchanged circumstances,
	recurring lights and noises, chiefly
	claiming attention in the night. Thus
	houses shut up and unaired are apt, from
	the putrefaction of animal and vegetable
	matter, to generate hydrogen gas, the accidental
	combustion of which by contact
	with phosphoric matter, naturally generated
	in the same situation, will produce
	those effects of lights and noises heard in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>empty houses. So Church-yards, Churches
	in which the dead are buried, Cemeteries,
	and Ruins of old buildings, must <ins id="fix_3" title="was ‘frequenty’">frequently</ins>
	give out large quantities of these
	gases; and consequently, from exactly similar
	causes, they are likely to produce the
	very effects which we witness in the will-o’-the-wisp,
	or in hydrogen gas when
	inflamed during calm weather in marshy
	situations.</li>

	<li>To the prevailing belief that effects,
	which cannot readily be accounted for, or
	which are caused by the contact of the
	invisible fluids or media always in action
	in the great laboratory of nature, are produced
	by the agency of spirits or demons;
	which belief, concurring with the unknown
	causes of the effects, and affording a ready
	solution of difficulties, prevents further
	inquiry, silences reasoning, and tends in
	consequence to sustain the prevailing errors
	and superstitions.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Such are the general causes of ghosts,
	spirits, charms, miracles, and supernatural
	appearances. They all arise either
	from hallucinations of the mind or senses;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"> </a>from the mutual action of the natural,
	though invisible, powers of gaseous and
	ethereal fluids; from the delusions of ignorance,
	implicit faith, or the absence of
	all reasoning.</p>

	<p>While occupied in these speculations,
	I arrived at the entrance of the populous,
	industrious, and opulent village of Wandsworth.
	A reader in the highlands of
	Scotland, in the mountains of Wales, or
	the wilds of Connaught, will startle when
	he hears of a village containing 5,644 inhabitants,
	and 2,020 houses, in which 620
	families are returned as engaged in trade
	and manufactures. Yet, such are the
	overgrown villages round our overgrown
	metropolis. Even in this vicinity, Chelsea
	contains 18,262 inhabitants; Fulham 5,903;
	Clapham 5,083; Hammersmith 7,393;
	Kensington 10,886; Brentford, New and
	Old, 7,094; and Richmond 5,219. This
	village of Wandsworth, in truth, is of the
	size of most second-rate towns in distant
	counties, its main street, of compact and
	well-built houses, being half a mile in
	length, with several collateral ones a quarter
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>of a mile. It also contains, or has in
	its vicinity, many considerable manufactories,
	which flourished exceedingly before
	the silly vanity of ambition and military
	parade led a nation of merchants to
	endeavour to dictate to their foreign customers,
	and forced them to subsist without
	their commodities! The manufactories
	of Wandsworth are created or greatly aided
	by the pure stream of the Wandle, and
	by the Surry iron rail-way, which runs
	from Croydon to a spacious and busy
	wharf, on the Thames at this place. They
	consist of dyers, calico-printers, oil-mills,
	iron-founderies, vinegar-works, breweries,
	and distilleries. I found leisure to inspect
	the two or three which were employed;
	and I felt renewed delight on witnessing
	at this place the economy of horse-labour
	on the iron rail-way. Yet a heavy sigh
	escaped me, as I thought of the inconceivable
	millions which have been spent
	about Malta, four or five of which might
	have been the means of extending <em>double
	lines of iron rail-ways</em> from London to
	Edinburgh, Glasgow, Holyhead, Milford,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>Falmouth, Yarmouth, Dover and Portsmouth!
	A reward of a single thousand
	would have supplied coaches, and other
	vehicles of various degrees of speed, with
	the best tackle for readily turning out;
	and we might, ere this, have witnessed
	our mail coaches running at the rate of
	ten miles an hour, drawn by a single
	horse, or impelled fifteen miles by Blenkinsop’s
	steam-engine! Such would have
	been a legitimate motive for overstepping
	the income of a nation, and the
	completion of so great and useful a work
	would have afforded <em>rational</em> grounds for
	public triumph in general jubilees!</p>

	<p>Wandsworth having been the once-famed
	scene of those humorous popular
	elections of a mayor, or member for
	<em class="special_name">Garrat</em>; and the subject serving to illustrate
	the manners of the times, and
	abounding in original features of character,
	I collected among some of its elder
	inhabitants a variety of amusing facts and
	documents, relative to the eccentric candidates
	and their elections.</p>

	<p>Southward of Wandsworth, a road extends
	<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"> </a>nearly two miles to the village of
	Lower Tooting, and nearly midway are
	a few houses, or hamlet, by the side of a
	small common, called <em>Garrat</em>, from which
	the road itself is called <em>Garrat Lane</em>.
	Various encroachments on this common
	led to an association of the neighbours
	about three-score years since, when they
	chose a president, or <em>mayor</em>, to protect
	their rights; and the time of their first
	election, being the period of a new parliament,
	it was agreed that the mayor
	should be re-chosen after every general
	election. Some facetious members of the
	club gave, in a few years, local notoriety
	to this election; and, when party spirit ran
	high in the days of <em>Wilkes and Liberty</em>,
	it was easy to create an appetite for a
	burlesque election among the lower orders
	of the metropolis. The publicans at
	Wandsworth, Tooting, Battersea, Clapham,
	and Vauxhall, made a purse to give
	it character; and Mr. Foote rendered its
	interest universal, by calling one of his
	inimitable farces, “<em>the Mayor of Garrat</em>.”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"> </a>I have indeed been told, that Foote, Garrick,
	and Wilkes, wrote some of the candidates’
	addresses, for the purpose of instructing
	the people in the corruptions
	which attend elections to the legislature,
	and of producing those reforms by means
	of ridicule and shame, which are vainly
	expected from solemn appeals of argument
	and patriotism.</p>

	<p>Not being able to find the members for
	Garrat in Beatson’s Political Index, or in
	any of the Court Calendars, I am obliged
	to depend on tradition for information in
	regard to the early history of this famous
	borough. The first mayor of whom I
	could hear was called Sir John Harper.
	He filled the seat during two parliaments,
	and was, it appears, a man of wit, for, on
	a dead cat being thrown at him on the
	hustings, and a bye-stander exclaiming that
	it stunk worse than a fox, Sir John vociferated,
	“that’s no wonder, for you see
	it’s a <em>poll</em>-cat.” This noted baronet was,
	in the metropolis, a retailer of brick-dust;
	and, his Garrat honours being supposed to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>be a means of improving his trade and the
	condition of his ass, many characters in
	similar occupations were led to aspire to
	the same distinctions.</p>

	<p>He was succeeded by Sir Jeffrey Dunstan,
	who was returned for three parliaments,
	and was the most popular candidate
	that ever appeared on the Garrat
	hustings. His occupation was that of
	buying <strong class="special_emphasis">OLD WIGS</strong>, once an article of trade
	like that in old clothes, but become obsolete
	since the full-bottomed and full-dressed
	wigs of both sexes went out of fashion.
	Sir Jeffrey usually carried his wig-bag over
	his shoulder, and, to avoid the charge of
	vagrancy, vociferated, as he passed along
	the streets, “old wigs;” but, having a person
	like Esop, and a countenance and manner
	marked by irresistible humour, he never
	appeared without a train of boys, and
	curious persons, whom he entertained by
	his sallies of wit, shrewd sayings, and
	smart repartees; and from whom, without
	begging, he collected sufficient to maintain
	his dignity of mayor and knight. He was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"> </a>no respecter of persons, and was so severe
	in his jokes on the corruptions and
	compromises of power, that, under the
	iron regime of Pitt and Dundas, when
	freedom was treason, and truth was blasphemy,
	this political punch, or street-jester,
	was prosecuted for using what were
	then called seditious expressions; and, as
	a caricature on the times, which ought
	never to be forgotten, he was in 1793
	tried, convicted, and imprisoned! In
	consequence of this affair, and some
	charges of dishonesty, he lost his popularity,
	and, at the general election for
	1796, was ousted by Sir Harry Dimsdale,
	muffin-seller, a man as much deformed as
	himself. Sir Jeffrey could not long survive
	his fall; but, in death as in life, he
	proved a satire on the vices of the proud,
	for in 1797 he died, like Alexander the
	Great, and many other heroes renowned in
	the historic page—of suffocation from excessive
	drinking!</p>

	<p>Sir Harry Dimsdale dying also before
	the next general election, and no candidate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>starting of sufficient originality of
	character, and, what was still more fatal,
	the victuallers having failed to raise a
	<strong class="special_emphasis">PUBLIC PURSE</strong>, which was as stimulating
	a bait to the <em>independent</em> candidates for
	Garrat, as it is to the <em>independent</em> candidates
	for a certain assembly; the borough
	of Garrat has since remained vacant, and
	the populace have been without a <em>professed</em>
	political buffoon.</p>

	<p>None but those who have seen a London
	mob on any great holiday can form
	a just idea of these elections. On several
	occasions, a hundred thousand persons,
	half of them in carts, in hackney-coaches,
	and on horse and ass-back, covered
	the various roads from London,
	and choaked up all the approaches to the
	place of election. At the two last elections,
	I was told, that the road within a
	mile of Wandsworth was so blocked up by
	vehicles, that none could move backward
	or forward during many hours; and that
	the candidates, dressed like chimney-sweepers
	on May-day, or in the mock-fashion
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"> </a>of the period, were brought to
	the hustings in the carriages of peers,
	drawn by six horses, the owners themselves
	condescending to become their
	drivers!</p>

	<p>Whether the effect of inculcating useful
	principles by means of these mock politicians,
	was compensated by the ridicule
	thrown on the sacred exertions of patriotism,
	may perhaps be doubted. These
	elections served, however, to keep alive
	the feelings of the people on public questions,
	and tended to increase those discussions
	and enquiries which support the
	arterial circulation of the body politic.
	The deadly plague of despotism, and the
	equally fatal disease of ministerial corruption,
	find victims of their influence
	only among people who are devoid of
	moral energies and public spirit, and
	whose stagnant and torpid condition generates
	morbid dispositions that invite, rather
	than resist, the attacks of any public
	enemy.</p>

	<p>I am a friend, therefore, on principle,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"> </a>to the bustle and tumult of popular elections.
	They are the flint and steel, the
	animating friction, the galvanic energy, of
	society. Virtue alone can face them.
	Vice dreads them as it dreads the light.
	With uncourtly hands, they tear the mask
	from Hypocrisy; they arraign at the
	bar of public opinion, political Culprits,
	amenable to no other tribunal; and they
	probe to the quick, the seared consciences
	of Peculators and Oppressors. If the
	sycophants of courts, and the sophistical
	apologists of arbitrary power, should craftily
	urge that the people are sometimes
	misled by fraud and falsehood, and therefore
	unable to distinguish between patriots
	and plunderers, we should not forget that
	occasional errors are misfortunes which do
	not abrogate general rights; and that popular
	elections are never adopted in well-trained
	despotisms, as part of the machinery
	of the state, calculated to subjugate
	the bodies and minds of their slaves.
	Do we hear of the suffrages of the people
	among the Turks, the Russians, the Moors,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>or the Algerines? Rather, as the means
	of eliciting the public voice, and of exciting
	enquiry, are they not of all despotisms,
	the bane; and of all usurpations and
	abuses of power, the terror; while, by
	generating that public spirit which is the
	animating soul of freedom, they serve as
	tests of dauntless public virtue, afford
	the last and the best hope of patriotism,
	and constitute national schools, in which
	impressive Lessons of Liberty are taught
	to the whole people.</p>

	<p>In my walk towards Garrat, my attention
	was attracted by a pretty mansion,
	which pleased my eye, though the monotonous
	blows of its adjoining oil-mill annoyed
	my ear. The owner, Mr. Were,
	politely exhibited its details; and more
	mechanical ingenuity than is here displayed
	could not well be applied to aid the
	simple operation of extracting oil from
	linseed. A magnificent water-wheel, of
	thirty feet, turns a main shaft, which gives
	motion to a pair of vertical stones, raises
	the driving-beams, and turns a band
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>which carries the seed, in small buckets,
	from the floor to the hopper. The shock
	on the entire nervous system, produced by
	the noise of the driving-beams as they fall
	on the wedges, is not to be described.
	The sense of hearing for the time is
	wholly destroyed, and the powers of voice
	and articulation are vainly exerted. The
	noise is oppressive, though a rebound,
	comparatively tuneful, takes place, till the
	wedge is driven home; but afterwards, the
	blows fall dead, and produce a painful
	jarr on the nerves, which affected me for
	several hours with a sense of general lassitude.
	The gardens of this sensible manufacturer
	evince considerable taste, and
	produce that agreeable effect which always
	results from the combination of comfort,
	rural beauty, and useful industry. A
	manufactory in a picturesque situation,
	surrounded by the usual characters of
	opulence, is one of the most pleasing
	features of an English landscape, combining
	whatever we most admire in nature
	and art, with moral associations, that produce
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>in the mind a sentiment of perfect
	satisfaction.</p>

	<p>Nearer to Wandsworth, Homer would
	have found imagery by which to improve
	his description of the abode of Vulcan;
	for how feeble must have been the objects
	of this nature, which a poet could
	view on the shores of the Mediterranean,
	compared with the gigantic machinery of
	an English iron-foundry. The application
	of the expansive powers of nature,
	as a moving agent in the steam-engine;
	the means of generating and concentrating
	heat in our furnaces; the melting of iron;
	the casting of the fluid; the colossal
	powers of the welding hammer, the head
	of which, though a ton in weight, gives a
	stroke per second; the power of shears,
	which cut thick bars of iron like threads;
	the drawing out of iron hoops by means
	of rollers, and the boring of cannon, are
	the every-day business of one of these
	manufactories, all of which I saw going
	on at the same instant, without bustle or
	effort. Iron, the most universal, the most
	<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"> </a>durable, and most economical of the
	metals, is thus made subservient to the
	wants of man, at a time when his improvidence
	in the use of timber has rendered
	some substitute necessary. New applications
	are daily made of it, and a new
	face is, by its means, promised to society.
	Used as sleepers and bond-pieces in the
	brick-work of houses, it will extend their
	duration through many ages; and, as
	joists, rafters, and plates for roofs, it will
	defy the assaults of storms and the ravages
	of fire. As railing for gardens, parks,
	and other enclosures, it combines elegance
	with security. As pipes for gas, or for
	water, it is justly preferred to lead or
	wood. As frames for windows, it unites
	lightness with durability. As bedsteads,
	it excludes vermin; and, as square frames
	for bridge-pieces, it presents the triumph
	of human art. Yet these are only a few
	of its modern applications, for they are
	illimitable, and a description of the manufactories
	of Birmingham and Sheffield, of
	which iron is the staple, would fill a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>volume. On my remarking to the proprietor
	of this foundry, that the men
	mingled themselves with the fire like salamanders;
	he told me, that, to supply
	the excessive evaporation, some of them
	found it necessary to drink eight or ten
	pots of porter per day. Many of them
	presented in their brawny arms, which
	were rendered so by the constant exertion
	of those limbs; and in their bronzed countenances,
	caused by the action of the
	heat and the effluvia, striking pictures of
	true sons of Vulcan; and, except in occasional
	accidents, they enjoyed, I was
	told, general good health, and often attained
	a hearty old age.</p>


	<p>In regard to these manufactories, I
	learnt, that the application of machinery
	in them saves two-thirds of the manual
	labour; or, in other words, that a triple
	effect is produced by the union of a given
	number of hands, with appropriate machinery.
	In this we rejoice; but, from
	our past experience of the effects, I ask
	emphatically, <em class="special_name">Why</em>? If in this age the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>same necessaries and luxuries are produced
	by one-third of the manual labour
	which was required in the age of Elizabeth,
	it is evident that the English of
	this day ought to subsist as well by working
	not more than half as much as in
	the days of Elizabeth, or our boasted
	machinery is useless. By making the
	wind, the water, the elastic fluids, and new
	combinations of the mechanical powers,
	perform our labour, we compel Nature to
	work for us; and, though in a northern
	latitude, we place ourselves in the very
	situation of the inhabitants of the Tropics,
	where the ever-bountiful climate feeds
	the people with slight exertions of manual
	labour. Yet, is such the effect? Enquire
	of our labouring classes, who toil for inadequate
	subsistence from twelve to fifteen
	hours per day! Does not some
	malevolent influence then deprive us of
	the advantages of our ingenuity? Doubtless
	it is so; and the <em class="special_name">Demon of War</em>,
	who has so long hovered over this deluded
	nation, and whose calls for blood and treasure
	<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>are so insatiable, is the sufficient cause.
	But on this subject the voice of reason
	and humanity have been raised so often,
	that it seems to be as useless as the appeals
	of a mother, standing on the seashore,
	to the tempest which is destroying
	her children in a visible wreck. Infatuated
	nations are like exhilarated dram-drinkers;
	they ridicule and despise warning,
	till a palsy or apoplexy renders them
	a proverb among their neighbours, and
	brings on a death-bed, but unavailing,
	repentance!</p>

	<p>I had not time to view any of the other
	ingenious and valuable manufactories of
	this place; but, perceiving that the manufacturers
	formed a numerous and opulent
	class of inhabitants, and that there
	were many elegant mansions of families
	living on their fortunes, besides many
	respectable shop-keepers, I was induced
	to seek information in regard to the state
	of society and mutual intercourse in a
	country-town possessing such capabilities.
	On enquiring at the principal Inn, I
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"> </a>found that a subscription-assembly was
	held six times in the year, at an expence
	of three guineas, but it had only
	thirty-two subscribers, though within a
	mile there then were a hundred families
	that kept their own carriages, and another
	hundred qualified by habit and manners
	to give and receive pleasure at such an
	entertainment. I learnt, however, that
	this solitary establishment, the only means
	by which the inhabitants can practically
	feel that they do not live in a wilderness,
	is poisoned at its source by a strict ballot,
	which places the privilege of admission
	in the discretion of any two or three
	narrow-minded and impertinent persons,
	who may have become directors. Of
	course, no man of sense or delicacy would
	ever expose himself and family to the
	insult of being black-balled; and these
	institutions, which are calculated to promote
	general happiness, become, in consequence,
	a source of mortification to the
	majority of a neighbourhood, and of petty
	and inadequate gratification to those
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>whose inanity of character, or obsequiousness
	of manners, have rendered them tolerable
	to the family, or small junto, who
	usually take it upon themselves to govern
	such assemblies.</p>

	<p>Some observations on this subject merit
	record, because happiness is the end of
	life, the proper business of study, and the
	true object of all disquisition; and there
	is no point in which families are rendered
	more uncomfortable, and in which the
	spirit of caprice and tyranny is more
	successfully exerted, than in the institution
	and conduct of country assemblies;
	while, at the same time, nothing would
	be easier than to render them a means
	of happiness to all who are capable of it.
	It is evident, that many persons, by habit
	and education, are ill-adapted to take part
	in the polite amusements of an assembly;
	that some men are odious by their vices;
	and that many females of equivocal character
	ought not to be allowed to mix
	with the virtuous part of the sex; consequently,
	every inhabitant of a district ought
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>not to be admitted to join in amusements
	which imply the contact of dancing and
	cards. It is also too certain, that a contemptible
	and unworthy pride often accompanies
	the wealth which assumes an ascendancy
	in assemblies; that scandal and
	falsehood more commonly govern the decisions
	of society than charity and truth;
	and that the base passions of envy and
	malice mix themselves more or less with
	all human conduct. What then is the
	security against the intrusion of the vicious?
	A ballot, in which one black-ball
	in ten, or sometimes two or three among
	the whole body of the subscribers, operate
	as an exclusion, that is to say, are a means
	of setting a mark on a family, and placing
	it at issue with a considerable portion of
	the neighbourhood! What a pernicious
	engine for the gratification of pride, scandal,
	envy, and malice! What an inquisition
	of the few bad by which to torment
	the many good! What a dagger in the
	hands of tolerated assassins! In short,
	what a perversion of reason, what a disease
	<a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"> </a>in the very bosom of society, what a
	lurking demon stationed at the threshold
	of every happy family, to blast and thwart
	the modest ambition of its amiable members!
	Doubtless, in and near Wandsworth,
	a mistaken constitution in the
	system of ballot renders a hundred families
	uncomfortable, while the thirty-two
	elect are not benefitted. The principle,
	therefore, is erroneous, and exclusion
	should result only from a <em>majority</em> of
	black-balls. For the honour of our nature
	we may presume, that a majority of
	men are not governed by bad passions;
	at least, our only security consists in its
	not being so: it may, therefore, be presumed,
	that a majority of black-balls would
	be fair evidence of a fault in the candidate
	rather than in the electors. Perhaps, a
	simple majority ought to be decisive; but,
	to guard against the intrigues of bad passions,
	the decision would be more just if
	two-thirds were required to be black-balls;
	for it may be safely trusted, that no third
	of a respectable assembly will ever vote
	<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"> </a>for the admission of a character truly objectionable.</p>

	<p>“But am I to mix,” exclaims one of
	my starch female readers, “with members
	whom I do not like, or give up my subscription
	to the assembly.” “Unquestionably,
	Madam; your dislikes ought not
	to be gratified—your hatred and prejudice
	are odious vices, which you ought to keep
	at home, where you can invite whomsoever
	you like, and reject those whom you
	dislike; but a public assembly is the property
	of society, whose happiness ought
	to be consulted in its arrangements, and
	which ought to be governed by general
	rules of morals and justice, and not by
	the bad passions of the unworthy few.”</p>

	<p>After all, is it not matter of wonder,
	that only once a month, during the winter,
	any congregation of part of the inhabitants
	of Wandsworth takes place for purposes
	of amusement? Yet, is not this
	the general characteristic of English society,
	from the Orkneys to the Land’s-End?
	The inhabitants of populous districts
	<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"> </a>or towns in Britain might as well,
	in regard to their intercourse with the community,
	live in the wilds of America or
	Siberia! ’Tis true, they assemble on Sundays
	at church or chapel when their devotions
	forbid the gaiety which ought to vary
	the grave pursuits of life—and they meet
	also in the common receptacle of mortality
	in the parish cemetery—but they seldom
	or never meet to cheer life’s dull
	round, to soften asperities, to remove
	formal distances, to cultivate friendships,
	and to perform social and neighbourly
	offices of courtesy and kindness. Why
	is there not, in every populous vicinage
	or adjoining to every town, a public gravelled,
	or paved, Walk, provided with covered
	and open seats, to which, from
	spring to autumn, the inhabitants might
	resort, and promenade between the hours
	of six and eight or nine. Might not such
	walk be rendered attractive, during those
	hours, by being provided with two, three,
	or four Musicians to play marches and
	lively airs, and increase the hilarity of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"> </a>the scene? A district would thus become
	social, and the inhabitants would know
	each other; though the proud need not mix
	with the humble more than would be
	agreeable. Such an arrangement would render
	less necessary those costly and vitiating
	excursions to watering-places, which
	are made in quest of similar gratifications;
	and they would render two hours of every
	twenty-four a period of enjoyment to tens
	of thousands, who now enjoy no relief
	from gloomy cares, except at the public-house,
	the card-table, or the backgammon-board.
	It would, moreover, be
	a cheap pleasure, supported by a rate
	of half-a-guinea per house per annum,
	while it would afford at least 1000 hours
	of innocent and healthful gratification to
	their families. To enumerate all the direct
	and collateral advantages must be
	unnecessary, because it would be difficult
	to imagine a single objection that could
	weigh against the obvious benefits. Society
	would then become a social state;
	and it would no longer be problematical,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"> </a>whether a man in a wilderness, separated
	from the bad passions of his fellow-men,
	were not happier than he who is surrounded
	by them, but who has no counterpoise
	in their intercourse and affections? May
	these considerations sink deep into the
	minds of “Men of Ross,” wherever they are
	to be found; and, if acted upon as they
	merit, I may perhaps live to form one of
	many happy groupes of village or parish
	promenades, which owe their origin to
	these observations.</p>

	<p>As an infallible test of the intellectual
	cultivation and social dispositions of
	any town, I enquired of two dealers
	in books, whether there existed any
	Book-club, but was answered in the negative.
	A small collection of those beguilers
	of time, or cordials for <em>ennui</em>, called Novels
	constitute a circulating library; and,
	judging from the condition of the volumes,
	this degree of literary taste is general
	among the females of this village. Far
	be it from me to depreciate the negative
	merits of novel-reading, because the majority
	<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"> </a>tend to improve the heart, to
	direct the sensibilities and sympathies of
	the mind, and to create many liberal and
	rational reflections, to which without Novels
	their readers might have been total strangers.
	This is no small praise of any pursuit;
	yet the same and still higher purposes
	would be attained, if real, rather than fictitious,
	life were the object of study; if we
	enquired after man as he was, is, and ever
	will be, instead of satisfying ourselves with
	the contemplation of him in the false colourings,
	distorted positions, and caricature
	resemblances, of many works of
	fiction. There can, however, exist no
	moral agent more effective than a good
	novel, wherein Attention is rivetted by
	the author’s fancy, Taste is fascinated by his
	style, and Errors, Prejudices, and Follies
	of the hour are corrected by his powers
	of ridicule or argument. To instruct
	as well as to amuse—to speak great truths
	in epigrams—to exhibit the substance of
	sermons without sermonizing—to be wise
	without appearing so—to make philosophers
	<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"> </a>trifle, and triflers philosophize—to
	exhibit precept in action—and to surprise
	the judgment through the medium of the
	passions and the love of the marvellous,—ought
	to be the purposes of those who
	cultivate this interesting branch of literary
	composition.</p>

	<p>Yet, unsociable as is Wandsworth, it is
	in that respect like all the villages round
	London. Gay and splendid as they appear
	to the summer visitor, nothing can
	be more dull and monotonous than the
	lives of their constant residents. Made
	up of the mushroom aristocracy of trade,
	whose rank, in its first generation, affords
	no palpable ground of introduction—of
	pride, whose importance, founded on the
	chances of yesterday, is fed on its self-sufficiency—of
	individuals whose consequence
	grows neither out of manners, intellectual
	endowments, superior taste, nor
	polished connections—and of inhabitants of
	a metropolis, among whom shyness of intercourse
	is necessary as a security against
	imposture—it is not to be wondered that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"> </a>most of the showy mansions in these villages
	are points of repulsion rather than
	of attraction. It must, however, be conceded,
	that many of these families are
	hospitable, charitable, sociable, and anxious
	to be agreeable—qualities which would
	serve as the basis of systems of more liberal
	intercourse, if properly directed, and if
	cherished in such establishments as book-clubs,
	periodical assemblies, and evening
	promenades. Nor should it be forgotten
	that many of the proprietors of these
	mansions consider them as mere retreats
	from the craft and selfish jargon of the
	world, in which, to enjoy the contrast
	afforded by the simplicity of nature, they
	court Solitude, for its own sake, during
	their temporary residence from evening till
	morning, and from Saturday till Monday.</p>

	<p>In a Village once famous for its manufactories,
	which, as the effect of the wicked
	Policy that involved the country in twenty
	years’ warfare, have lost their powers
	of giving employment to the population
	whom they had drawn together, I was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"> </a>naturally led to inquire the condition of
	these helpless victims of deluded and deluding
	statesmen. What an affecting topic
	for the contemplation of Sensibility! How
	painful the condition of Poverty, contrasted
	with that of Wealth; yet how
	closely are they allied, and how adventitiously
	separated! The Rich solace
	themselves in a fancied exemption from
	the miseries and ignominy which attach
	to the Poor, though their daily experience
	of the caprice of fortune ought to
	teach them, that, while they have the
	power, it would be wiser to diminish the
	contrast by ameliorating the condition of
	Poverty! How glorious is the spectacle
	afforded by the contrast of civilized society,
	with the wretched condition of savages,
	though that justly admired civilization
	is often but a result of artifices that
	create the distinctions of rich and poor!
	What a gulph between the ancient Britons
	in the social equality of their woods and
	caverns, and the favoured English in their
	luxurious cities and magnificent palaces!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"> </a>Yet, alas! wealth and splendour and greatness
	are such only by contrast!—Wherever
	there are rich there must be poor—wherever
	there is splendour there must be misery—and
	wherever there are masters there must
	be servants. These conditions of men
	in society are like the electrical power in
	nature, which never indicates its positive
	qualities without creating corresponding
	negations; and which, when equally diffused,
	exhibits no phenomena. If then
	men are rich merely because they have abstracted
	or absorbed the wealth of others,
	their obligations, as moral and sympathetic
	creatures towards those by whose abasement
	they are exalted, can require no
	formal proof. The laws may allow, and
	the arrangements of society may require,
	as a condition of civilization, that the rich
	should enjoy their ascendency; but it is
	neither just, nor wise, nor decent, nor
	humane, nor necessary, that the poor
	should be deprived of benefits which ought
	to result to the whole family of man, from
	the triumphs of Art over Nature. All are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page104" title="104"> </a>bound cheerfully to concede to superiority
	in virtue and intellect, those advantages
	which are the result of virtuous and intellectual
	exertions; but, as common descendants
	of the once-equal Britons, the lowest
	are warranted in claiming, as matter of
	right, to be as well fed and as comfortably
	provided for, on performing, or on evincing
	a willingness to perform, the duties of
	their stations, as their equal ancestors
	among the Britons, or society at large cannot
	be said to have profitted by our boasted
	civilization. To adjust these intricate relations,
	so that all virtue may partake in
	its sphere of the gifts of nature, augmented
	by the ingenuity of man, is the arduous,
	but interesting, task of wise legislation.
	It would not be reasonable to expect, that
	every case should be met, and every exigency
	anticipated, by adequate arrangements;
	but it is the duty of power, in whomsoever
	it is placed, to exert itself with unremitting
	anxiety, so as in the arrangements of man
	to approximate to the dispositions of nature,
	which are always marked by inexhaustible
	<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"> </a>abundance, by appropriate benevolence,
	and by means commensurate
	to suitable and desirable ends.</p>

	<p>Under the influence of such reasoning,
	I made a variety of enquiries between
	Battersea and Wandsworth, relative to
	the condition of the poor. I learnt with
	grief that the payment of day-labourers
	varies from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per day, or on
	an average is not more than 12<i>s.</i> per week;
	of women from 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> or about 6<i>s.</i>
	per week; and of children from 9<i>d.</i> to 6<i>d.</i>
	or 4<i>s.</i> per week; though, for the two last
	classes there is sufficient employment for
	only half the year. A poor man, who
	had a wife and three children to maintain
	on 14<i>s.</i> per week, told me, that for many
	months he and his family had been strangers
	to meat, cheese, butter, or beer—that
	bread, potatoes, nettles, turnips, carrots,
	and onions, with a little salt, constituted
	the whole of their food—that during the
	winter months he was obliged to rely on
	the parish—that in case of sickness he and
	his children had no resource besides the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"> </a>workhouse—and that, though it had pleased
	God to take two of his children, it was
	better they should go to heaven than continue
	in this wicked and troublesome
	world. “But I don’t think,” said he, “the
	gentlefolk saves much by running down
	we poor so nation hard, for we are obligated
	to get it on the parish, which they
	pay; so it’s all one; though it grieves a
	poor man, as one may say, to apply to
	them overseers, and to have no hope but
	the workhouse at last.”</p>

	<p>I agree with this humble Economist
	that it seems to be as ungenerous as impolitic
	to throw on the poor’s rates a burthen
	which ought to be borne by those
	who profit from the labour thus inadequately
	remunerated. It could not, and
	ought not, to be difficult to fix a minimum
	(not a maximum) on twelve hours’ labour
	per day, such as should be sufficient to
	support an average-sized family. Suppose
	for bread and flour 6<i>s.</i> were allowed; for
	meat, cheese, butter, milk, and beer, 4<i>s.</i>; for
	potatoes, &amp;c. 2<i>s.</i> candles, soap, and coals,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"> </a>2<i>s.</i> cloathing 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> house-rent 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> sundries
	1<i>s.</i>—total 21<i>s.</i> Here is nothing
	superfluous, nothing but what appertains
	to the earliest stages of civilization, and
	what every well-arranged society ought to
	be able to give in return for manual labour
	of the lowest kind. With inferior means
	the labourer must suffer the obloquy of
	being remunerated from the parish rates,
	to which all are forced to contribute as
	fully as though the employer paid the
	fair value of the labour in the first instance,
	and the amount were assessed on
	the price of his commodity, instead of
	being assessed in the form of poor’s
	rates.</p>

	<p>It being, however, the <em>favourite</em> system
	to pay the difference between what the
	labourer receives, and what he ought to
	receive, through the medium of the workhouse
	or parish officers, I anxiously directed
	my way to <em class="special_name">Wandsworth Workhouse</em>,
	to examine whether it was an asylum
	of comfort or a place of punishment?
	On my entrance I found the hall filled
	with a crowd of poor persons, then applying
	<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"> </a>to receive a weekly stipend from
	the overseers, who, with other parish-officers,
	were assembled in an adjoining
	apartment. Many women with infants at
	their breasts, and other children clinging
	round their knees, presented interesting
	subjects for poets and painters. Every
	feeling of the human heart, though in the
	garb of rags, and bearing the aspect of
	misery, evidently filled the various individuals
	composing this groupe. I pressed
	forward to the room, where I found the
	overseers were sitting at a table, covered
	with bank-tokens and other silver for distribution.
	They received me politely, and,
	on learning my wish to view the interior,
	directed the matron to accompany me.
	The manners and countenances of these
	overseers flatly contradicted the prejudices
	which are usually entertained against persons
	filling the office; and it gratified me
	to hear several of the poor, whose characteristic
	is said to be discontent, exclaim,
	“God bless ’em, they’re noble gentlemen.”</p>

	<p>The matron conducted me into a spacious
	yard, round which are suites of rooms,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page109" title="109"> </a>built in the manner of alms-houses, a plan
	which cannot be too much commended,
	because it sufficiently detaches the tenants
	of each, secures to every set their peculiar
	comforts, and may be rendered the means
	of separating virtue from vice. In the
	middle of the area stand the offices and
	kitchen, dividing it into two yards, one
	for the men, and the other for the
	women. The whole had been recently
	white-washed, and, but for the name of
	work-house, and certain restraints on their
	habits and liberty, it seemed calculated to
	secure the comfort of its inmates.</p>

	<p>The matron took me into several of the
	men’s rooms, and here I found tottering
	grey hairs, crippled youth, inveterately
	diseased of all ages, and artizans destitute
	of employment. Six or eight were in a
	room, though I was informed they slept
	for the most part but one in a bed. A
	fine young girl about twelve years old,
	who had slipped out of the women’s yard,
	was seated by the side of her father, an
	interesting looking artizan, whose trade
	<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>had ceased to afford him employment.
	This, I found, was contrary to the discipline
	of the house, and the matron chid
	the girl for coming there; “however,”
	said she to me in an under-tone, with
	great good nature—“one can’t blame a
	child for getting to her father, nor the
	father for encouraging his child to come
	over to him.”—“No, madam,” said I,
	“and no one can blame you for granting
	such an indulgence, while all must admire
	the goodness of heart which dictates that
	sentiment.” Would to God, thought I,
	that all workhouses were governed by matrons
	as capable of sympathizing with the
	feelings of the unfortunate inmates; and
	that all those who embitter poverty by
	directing the separation of parents from
	their children, and husbands from their
	wives, may themselves become the object
	of their own law!</p>

	<p>My guide now led me to a room where
	lived a man, his wife, and children, a sawyer
	out of work, whose eyes were so affected
	by the dust that falls into the pit,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>as to render him incapable of following
	his employment. His pride, as well as that
	of his wife, seemed to be piqued at being
	exhibited to view in the workhouse, and
	they took much pains to convince me that
	it was their misfortune, not their fault or
	their wish. Two fine children, one of
	them a chubby happy creature, playing
	on the floor, added to the groupe an
	interest that was deeply affecting. Doubtless,
	thought I, these simple people once
	entertained many projects of humble ambition,
	which, if explained, might draw a
	smile from the great—but here, alas! they
	seem to be entombed for ever!</p>

	<p>I now took a cursory view of the women’s
	yard, in which I found the same
	appearances of cleanliness and comfort as
	on the men’s side. But the most interesting
	scene was the nursery, where sixteen
	little cherubs, the oldest about five years,
	were engaged in their innocent diversions,
	regardless whether they were in a workhouse
	or a palace, and unsuspicious of
	the ills that await them in a world governed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>by selfishness, where the greatest of all
	crimes, and the forerunner of all calamities,
	is poverty! I was pleased to find
	that the mother of three of them was allowed
	to fill the office of nurse, and the
	tears trickled down the poor woman’s
	face, as I particularly admired one fine
	boy, who, it happened, was her child.
	“Ah! Sir, (said she,) he’s so like his poor
	father!—my poor husband little thought,
	when he died, that his dear children would
	so soon be in a workhouse”—here her
	tears and loud sobs stopt her utterance;
	but, recovering herself—“if I can’t maintain
	’em with the labour of my hands,
	(said she,) I will do what I can for ’em
	here; there is no other happiness for me
	in this world, and I will continue to do
	for them till God shall please to take me
	also.” A woman’s and mother’s tears
	are so contagious, and the scene before
	me formed so deep a drama of real life,
	that I hurried from the room!</p>

	<p>The good matron now showed her
	cleanly kitchen, her well-arranged laundry,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"> </a>pantry, bakehouse, &amp;c. &amp;c., with
	which my feelings were not at that moment
	in unison; I saw, however, much
	to admire and nothing to condemn. On
	inquiry, I found that these excellent regulations
	were the effect of a late revolution
	in the establishment. Till a very
	recent period, it had been the criminal
	practice of the overseers, and the negligent
	sufferance of the parish, to <strong class="special_emphasis">FARM</strong>
	or <strong class="special_emphasis">LET OUT</strong> the poor to some grim tyrant
	or task-master, at the average rate of
	5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head! This man was to provide
	for these wretched victims of the public
	neglect, and of his miscalculation, out
	of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week, rent exclusive; and
	his remuneration consisted in the difference
	between their cost and that pitiful
	allowance. The cries of the poor at
	length forced their way to the ears of the
	opulent, the contractor was turned out,
	and it was then humanely determined that
	the overseers, aided by a master and matron,
	should in future superintend the workhouse
	as trustees for the parish.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>I understood that they had hitherto
	performed this duty with great attention
	and humanity, giving meat-dinners four
	days in the week, and soup-dinners on
	the other days, the cost proving about
	6<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per head, on the one hundred
	poor in the house, of whom forty were
	children. In the petty labours with which
	the aged, crippled, and infant poor are too
	often harassed in these receptacles, they had,
	as yet, made no essays. The stipends out
	of the house amounted, I learned, to nearly
	as much as the cost within, or to about
	30<i>l.</i> per week, which, at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head,
	assists two hundred and forty objects,
	making a total charge on the parish of
	from 3 to 4000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

	<p>How many parishes in the metropolis
	still, however, persist in the negligent
	practice of farming their wretched poor
	at only 4<i>s.</i> or even 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week!
	And how few of the opulent, idle, and
	well-intentioned of the parishioners, concern
	themselves about their condition or
	sufferings! When the overseer calls for
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>the rates, they perhaps complain so heavily
	of the amount, that he fears to increase
	the allowance, however sensible he
	may be of its necessity; or, perhaps, when
	accosted by a beggar in the street, they
	excuse themselves by quoting their large
	contributions to the rates, and refer the
	despairing wretch to the workhouse! How
	incumbent then to see what that workhouse
	is!—Whether its arrangements are
	not more fitted for dogs or pigs, than for
	rational and heart-broken fellow-creatures,
	however unequal in fortune, or however
	differing even in virtue! Let us then
	neither wonder nor complain, that our
	streets or highways are filled with objects
	of misery, preferring the cold ground, the
	unsparing storm, and the inclemency of
	seasons, to the provisions legally provided
	for them; if we have not had the industry
	to ascertain, the courage to reform, and
	the benevolence to improve, the condition
	of their parochial asylums!</p>

	<p>The reader of sensibility will not, I
	trust, complain of the length of details
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>on an object which interests every son
	and daughter of Britain. The other demands
	on my time allowed me to spend
	but twenty minutes in this receptacle of
	the helpless and unfortunate; yet what a
	volume of feelings and reflections were
	excited in that short period! We have
	had a <em class="special_name">Howard</em>, I exclaimed, who visited
	our gaols and alleviated the condition of
	those who are forced to drink the dregs
	of the cup of misery, from the iron-hearted
	and unsparing hands of lawyers, whose
	practices are sometimes countenanced by
	the incorrigible character of criminals!
	We have a <em class="special_name">Webb</em>, who vainly assaults
	the giant Penury on the King’s highway,
	but whose frightful strides outstrip his
	generous speed!—We want then some
	<strong class="special_emphasis">ANGEL</strong>, in the form of man, who, uniting
	the courage and perseverance of a <em class="special_name">Howard</em>
	with the liberality of a <em class="special_name">Webb</em>, will
	visit and report on the condition of
	our Workhouses. But, if, as every parish
	contains its workhouse, and every county
	but one gaol, the task in consequence is
	<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>too great for one life, though actuated by
	the godlike zeal of a <em class="special_name">Wesley</em>; then it is
	a task worthy of parish committees, composed
	of groupes of Angels, in the form
	of benignant Women, who will find, that
	the best-spent and the happiest morning of
	every month would be passed in a visit
	to the workhouse; where, with slender
	alms, kind advice, and fostering care, they
	would be able to soothe the sorrows of
	the aged widow,—to comfort the sick and
	helpless,—to pour balm into the mental
	wounds of those who are reduced from
	affluence by misfortune,—to raise from
	hopeless indigence modest merit, which
	never found a friend,—and to protect orphan
	children, who need advice and pilotage
	in their outset in life. No pampered
	minion of fortune need complain of <em>ennui</em>,
	or be anxious for new amusements, in
	whose parish there exists a workhouse.
	It is a Stage on which Dramas, serious or
	tragical, are every day performed; the
	interest of which is created by no tricks
	of the author or machinist, but in which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>the performers play their parts according
	to nature, always touching the most sensitive
	chords of the heart. No spectator
	ever came away from one of these houses
	without having his feelings wrought up
	by actors of all ages, who far outstrip our
	Siddonses, Kembles, Bettys, Youngs, or
	Keans, and whose petit dramas excel
	those of Shakespeare, Rowe, or Otway,
	in the degree in which suffering and unsophisticated
	Nature is superior to the
	trappings and blandishments of Art.</p>

	<p>Wandsworth having engaged me above
	an hour, I endeavoured to recover my
	loitering, by a rapid pace towards <em class="special_name">Putney
	Heath</em>, where a crowd of objects
	presented themselves for description and
	observation.</p>

	<p>The road from <em class="special_name">Wandsworth</em> to <em class="special_name">Putney
	Heath</em> ascends with a gentle slope,
	which is inclined about six degrees from
	the horizontal plane. Wandsworth itself
	lies little above the level of the Thames
	at high water; and, as this road ascends
	nearly a mile, with an angle which averages
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>six degrees, the height of Putney
	and the adjoining Wimbledon Common
	may be taken at about the tenth of a mile,
	180 yards, or 540 feet. The ascent of
	one yard in ten gives that gentle fall to the
	road, which, in a smaller degree, ought
	to be conferred artificially on all roads,
	in order that they might drain lengthways,
	and that the argillaceous earth might be
	carried off in solution, and only the hard
	bed of silex remain behind. This beautiful
	piece of road is a fine exemplification
	of that principle; but an elevation of two
	degrees, or nearly one yard in thirty,
	would be sufficient for the purpose; and,
	if the rise and fall in flat roads were made
	to take place at every quarter of a mile,
	the difference between the bottoms and
	tops would be about fifteen yards. In
	general, the natural inequalities of the
	country would assist such a system of philosophical
	road-making; but, notwithstanding
	the first labour, it merits no less
	respect in all dead levels, as the only
	means of carrying off their standing water
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>and clay, and of establishing a hard bottom,
	which, when once formed, would last
	for many years. Any person who has not
	duly regarded this principle, will be struck
	with its justness, by taking notice, during
	a journey, of any piece of road from which
	the road-makers have been unable to turn
	a stream of running water; and he will
	find, that it possesses a hard smooth bottom,
	and stands less in need of repair than
	any road in the same vicinity. Let us
	then take a lesson from nature on this
	subject, as we do on all others when we
	evince our modesty and wisdom.</p>

	<p>The objection to this form of roads,
	founded on the increase of draught required
	in ascending one side of the inclined
	plane, has no validity. An inclination
	of two degrees rises one yard in
	thirty; consequently, such a power as
	would draw thirty tons on level ground,
	must, other circumstances alike, be equal
	to thirty-<em>one</em> tons on a road so inclined.
	The resistance of friction in roads which
	permit the wheels to sink into them, rises,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>however in a much higher proportion.
	It may be assumed, that wheels which sink
	but half an inch, would require an increased
	draught of an eighth, or, in the
	above instance, of 2½ tons; if an inch,
	they would require a fourth more, or 7½
	tons; if two inches, a half increase, or
	fifteen tons; and at three inches, the
	power would be required to be double.
	Different soils, and different wheels, would
	indicate different proportions, but the
	above may be taken as averages; and,
	when contrasted with the small increase
	of power, rendered necessary by the ascent
	of an inclined plane, the latter, on the
	ascending half of any road, will appear
	to be unimportant.</p>

	<p>The Emperor Napoleon, who endeavoured
	to apply philosophy to all the arts
	of life, decreed, that no public road in
	France should exceed an inclination of
	4° 46′, or rise more than one metre in
	twelve. This proportion, it was estimated,
	would combine the maxima and
	minima of the powers; and, in spite of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>those malignant confederacies which he
	was so often called upon to overthrow,
	the labour of reducing many steep roads
	of France to this practicable inclination
	was accomplished, and hence the praises
	of the roads of that country which we
	read in the narratives of our tourists.
	England, which set the first example to
	Europe, in this branch of economy, ought
	not to allow itself to be outdone by the
	measures of a reign which it asserted was
	incompatible with regal dignity; but, proceeding
	on correct principles, it ought
	in this case to imitate even a <em>bad</em> example,
	and to correct its system of patching up
	its roads under the direction of surveyors,
	ignorant of general principles, and at the
	expence of local commissioners, who are
	interested in making their improvements
	on the narrowest scale. The rapid advancement
	of Great Britain in social comforts,
	within the last sixty years, may be
	ascribed to the turnpike system, which
	took the jurisdiction of the public roads
	out of the hands of parish-officers, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>transferred it to commissioners of more
	extensive districts. A still further improvement
	is now called for by superadding
	the controul of a <strong class="special_emphasis">NATIONAL ROAD POLICE</strong>,
	which should equalize the tolls,
	or apply the whole to the unequal wants
	of various districts; so that roads of
	nearly equal goodness might characterize
	all parts of an empire which ought to be
	rendered one great metropolis, and to be
	united in means and fraternity by all the
	facilities of human art.</p>

	<p>A stage-coach toiling against this road
	of six degrees inclination, and a flour-waggon
	traversing from side to side to
	lengthen the hypotheneuse, yet stopping
	at every hundred yards to enable the
	horses to recover their ordinary tone of
	breathing, proved the good policy of that
	law in France, which would have lowered
	this road at the top full thirty yards, and
	have extended the hypotheneuse three
	hundred and sixty yards under the level
	road at the summit. If the barbarity of
	the practice of tight-reining the heads of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>wretched horses needed any exaggeration,
	its superlative absurdity was evidenced in
	the horses which I saw labouring up this
	hill. Nature, which does nothing in
	vain, had a final purpose in giving motion
	to the vertebræ that join the head of an
	animal to the trunk. The moving head
	is, in truth, one of the extremities of that
	compound animal lever, whose fulcrum
	is the centre of gravity. The latter point
	is disturbed in its inertia, and acquires
	progressive motion by the action of the
	extremities of the lever, which are themselves
	moved by volition, whose seat is
	in the cranium; and the head, in consequence,
	is in all instances the first mover.
	The propulsion or vibration of the head
	puts the entire muscular system in motion,
	disturbs the balance on the centre of gravity,
	and so effects the sublime purposes
	of loco-motion in all animals. Yet it is
	this prime mover which the greater brutes,
	who profess themselves <em>knowing</em> in the
	economy of horses, so tie up that it can
	in no way exert itself; and then they whip
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"> </a>and spur the animal to force it to make
	new and unnatural exertions! Let any
	man, himself an erect animal, the powers
	of whose <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">primum mobile</em> are divided between
	his head and his hands, cause his
	head to be so tied back and fastened
	behind as to force out his chest. In that
	position let him try his comparative powers
	in walking or running with speed and
	safety, or in carrying or drawing a load,
	and he will soon be convinced of the
	cruelty of the practice of tying up the head
	of a horse for no other purpose than that
	he may <em>look</em> bold and noble! <em class="special_name">Wesley</em>
	and <em class="special_name">Bakewell</em>, who rode more than
	any men of their time, told me that they
	had suffered from frequent falls, till, by
	attending to the evident designs of nature,
	they suffered the bridle of their horses to
	festoon in a semicircle; and since then, in
	riding thousands of miles, they had never
	endured even the anxiety of a stumble.</p>

	<p>A pedestrian like the writer could not
	avoid feeling grateful to the constructor
	of this piece of road, for its beautiful and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>spacious causeway, which extends from
	the village of Wandsworth to Putney
	Heath. It is in most parts seven feet
	wide, and it doubtless owes much of its
	hardness, smoothness, and dryness, to its
	declining position, which causes the water
	to run off, carrying with it in solution the
	argillaceous earth, and leaving a basis of
	pure but well pulverized silex. All who
	reside in the country, ladies particularly,
	know how to estimate the worth of a
	broad, smooth, and dry walk, by the miseries
	so generally suffered from those of
	a contrary description. For the sake,
	therefore, of the example and the precept,
	they will candidly excuse the eulogy
	extorted from a wandering pedestrian on
	meeting with so agreeable an accommodation
	in a district, which, in many respects,
	seems appropriated to the caprice
	of wealth. To supply the deficiency of
	our Road Bills, one sweeping law ought
	to enact that all turnpike roads should
	be provided with a raised causeway for
	foot passengers, at least five feet wide,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>with cross posts at every furlong to prevent
	equestrians from abusing it, and with
	convenient seats at the end of every
	mile. It is too much to expect in these
	times to see realized the writer’s favourite
	plan of <strong class="special_emphasis">MILE-STONE</strong> and <strong class="special_emphasis">MARINE
	COTTAGES</strong>, among a people who have
	passionately mortgaged all their estates,
	and blindly encumbered all their industry,
	in paying the interest of money raised to
	carry on wars made for the purpose of
	regulating the independant governments
	of other countries!</p>

	<p>The sides of this road and the openings
	of the distant landscape, excite the admiration
	of the eye of taste by the architectural
	and horticultural beauties of mansions
	which have sprung out of the profits
	or artifices of trade. The multiplication
	of these dormitories of avarice is considered
	by too many as the sign of public
	prosperity. Fallacious, delusive, and
	mischievous notion! Was the world made
	for the many, or the few? Can any one
	become rich from domestic trade without
	<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>making others poor; or can another bring
	wealth from foreign countries except by
	adding to the circulating medium, and
	thereby diminishing the value of money?
	In either case, what is the benefit to the
	public or the community? Yet a benefit
	is rendered visible—a fine house has arisen
	where there stood before but a wretched
	hovel—and a paradise has been created
	out of a sheep pasture!—The benefit,
	however, is merely to the individual! His
	pride and taste have been gratified, and this
	gratification is called a benefit—yet with
	him the benefit, if to him it really be so,
	begins and ends. But he employs the
	neighbourhood, patronizes the arts, and
	encourages trade? Granted,—but whence
	come his means? His wealth is not miraculous.
	It has no exclusive or original
	properties. If he spend it at Putney,
	he must draw it from other places,
	either from rents of land or houses, or
	from interest of money, both the fruit of
	other’s industry, and the sign of corresponding
	privations in those who pay them!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"> </a>For the sake of the elegant arts, which
	derive their encouragement from the superfluities
	of the few, I am no enemy
	to any moderate inequalities of means
	which enable men to become examples
	of the good effects of industry; I merely
	object to the vulgar inference that splendid
	mansions serve as signs of the increasing
	wealth of a country. Better criterions
	would be the diffusion of plenty and comfort—abundance
	of smoking farm-houses
	and well-stored barns—<strong class="special_emphasis">CHEAP PROVISIONS</strong>
	and <strong class="special_emphasis">DEAR LABOUR</strong>—enough with
	moderate exertions for home consumption,
	and something to exchange for the luxuries
	of different climates. But it is no index of
	national prosperity that elegant villas rise
	like sun-flowers, as gaudy as unprofitable,
	while gaols are crammed with insolvents
	or needy culprits, and poor-houses are
	filled with wretchedness! Poland astonishes
	travellers by the splendour of its
	palaces; while in the same prospect they
	are shocked at the huts of the people,
	exhibiting the characteristics of English
	<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"> </a>hog-sties! Let the increase of splendour,
	therefore, be considered rather as a proof
	of the derangement of social order, than
	as any sign of its triumph; and let us not
	forget that, however much fine houses may
	benefit and gratify the blameless and often
	meritorious occupants, they do not, as
	such, serve as any signs of increased opulence
	in the community at large.</p>

	<p>On arriving near the top of this road,
	I obtained a distinct view of a phenomenon,
	which can be seen no where in
	the world but at this distance from London.
	The Smoke of nearly a million of
	coal fires, issuing from the two hundred
	thousand houses which compose London
	and its vicinity, had been carried in a
	compact mass in the direction which lay
	in a right angle from my station. Half a
	million of chimneys, each vomiting a bushel
	of smoke per second, had been disgorging
	themselves for at least six hours of the
	passing day, and they now produced a
	sombre tinge, which filled an angle of the
	horizon equal to 70°, or in bulk twenty-five
	<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"> </a>miles long, by two miles high. As this cloud
	goes forward it diverges like a fan, becoming
	constantly rarer; hence it is seldom perceived
	at its extremity, though it has been
	distinguished near Windsor. As the wind
	changes, it fills by turns the whole country
	within twenty or thirty miles of London;
	and over this area it deposits the volatilized
	products of three thousand chaldrons, or
	nine millions of pounds of coals per day,
	producing peculiar effects on the country.
	In London this smoke is found to blight
	or destroy all vegetation; but, as the vicinity
	is highly prolific, a smaller quantity
	of the same residua may be salutary, or
	the effect may be counteracted by the extra
	supplies of manure which are afforded by
	the metropolis. Other phenomena are
	produced by its union with fogs, rendering
	them nearly opaque, and shutting out the
	light of the sun; it blackens the mud of
	the streets by its deposit of tar, while the
	unctuous mixture renders the foot-pavement
	slippery; and it produces a solemn
	gloom whenever a sudden change of wind
	<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"> </a>returns over the town the volume that was
	previously on its passage into the country.
	One of the improvements of this age, by
	which the next is likely to benefit, has been
	its contrivances for more perfect combustion;
	and for the condensation and sublimation
	of smoke. The general adoption of a
	system of consuming the smoke would render
	the London air as pure as that of the
	country, and diminish many of the nuisances
	and inconveniences of a town residence.
	It must in a future age be as
	difficult to believe that the Londoners
	could have resided in the dense atmosphere
	of coal-smoke above described, as
	it is now hard to conceive that our ancestors
	endured houses without the contrivance
	of chimneys, from which consequently
	the smoke of fires had no means
	of escape but by the open doors and
	windows, or through a hole in the roof!</p>

	<p>On the left I passed the entrance into
	the tastefully planned, but very useless,
	park of the justly esteemed <em class="special_name">Earl Spencer</em>.
	It contains about seven hundred
	<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"> </a>acres, disposed so as to please the eye of
	a stranger, but which, like all <em>home-spots</em>,
	soon lose, from their familiarity, the power
	of delighting a constant occupant. Why
	then appropriate so fine a piece of ground
	to so barren a purpose? Does the gratification
	of strangers, and the first week’s
	pleasure to the owner, counterpoise the
	consideration that the same spot would
	afford the substantial ornament of ten farms,
	or subsistence to three hundred and forty
	cottages, with two acres of garden and
	pasture? The superb mansion of Lord
	Spencer, with all necessary garden-ground
	and pasturage, would not less ornament
	the landscape, nor be less ornamented by
	such an assemblage of humbler happiness.
	Though a <em class="special_name">Repton</em> might exhaust his
	magic art in arranging the still beauties of
	a park, yet how certainly would they pall
	on the eye after the daily survey of a
	month! Why then sacrifice to the pride
	of custom that which in other dispositions
	might add so much to the sum
	of happiness? Let the means of promoting
	<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"> </a>the felicity of others constitute
	part of our own; and, with the aid of the
	ornamental gardener, both objects might be
	combined. He would so dispose of his
	white-washed cottages, so groupe his farm-yards,
	and so cluster his trees, that from
	every window of the feudal mansion the
	hitherto solitary occupant might behold
	incessant variety, accompanied by the
	pleasing associations growing out of prosperous
	industry and smiling plenty. Does
	Claude ever revel in solitudes? Does
	Poussin fascinate in exhibitions of mechanical
	nature? And when does Woollet
	enchant us but in those rich landscapes
	in which the woods are filled with peeping
	habitations, and scope given for the imagination
	by the curling smoke of others rising
	behind the trees?</p>

	<p>On entering Putney Heath, my attention
	was drawn towards an obelisk which
	stands by the road-side, recording a wonder
	of the last age; and the liberal attention
	of the public authorities to a discovery
	which promised ulterior advantages
	<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"> </a>to the community. Several recent Fires
	had led ingenious men to consider of the
	means of preventing similar catastrophes.
	One person improved water-engines, another
	suggested floors of stucco, and others
	contrived means of escape; but David
	Hartley, esq. a son of the <ins id="fix_4" title="was ‘illustrions’">illustrious</ins> writer
	who traced to their sources the associations
	of Ideas, and then a member of parliament,
	contrived to build a house which
	no ordinary application of ignited combustibles
	could be made to consume.</p>

	<p>This house, still standing at the distance
	of a hundred yards from the obelisk, serves
	as a monument of the inventor’s plans;
	but, like every thing besides, it recently
	excited the avarice of speculation, and,
	when I saw it, was filled with workmen,
	who where converting it into a tasteful
	mansion, adding wings to it, throwing out
	verandas, and destroying every vestige of
	its original purpose. One of the workmen
	shewed me the chamber in which, in
	1774, the King and Queen took their
	breakfast; while, in the room beneath,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"> </a>fires were lighted on the floor, and various
	inflammable materials were ignited, to
	prove that the rooms above were fire-proof.
	Marks of these experiments were
	still visible on the charred boards. In like
	manner there still remained charred surfaces
	on the landings of the staircase,
	whereon fires had been ineffectually lighted
	for the purpose of consuming them,
	though the stairs and all the floorings
	were of ordinary deal! The fires in the
	rooms had been so strong that parts of
	the joists in the floor above were charred,
	though the boards which lay upon them
	were in no degree affected.</p>

	<p>The alterations making at the moment
	enabled me to comprehend the whole of
	Mr. Hartley’s system. Parts of the floors
	having been taken up, it appeared that
	they were double, and that his contrivance
	consisted in interposing between the two
	boards, sheets of laminated iron or copper.
	This metallic lining served to render
	the floor air-tight, and thereby to intercept
	the ascent of the heated air; so that,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"> </a>although the inferior boards were actually
	charred, the less inflammable material of
	metal prevented the process of combustion
	from taking place in the superior boards.
	These sheets of iron or copper, for I found
	both metals in different places, were not
	thicker than tinfoil or stout paper; yet,
	when interposed between the double set
	of boards, and, deprived of air, they effectually
	stopt the progress of the fire.</p>

	<p>The House of Commons voted 2500<i>l.</i>
	to Mr. Hartley to defray the expences of
	this building; the sovereign considered it
	a popular act to give him countenance;
	and a patriotic lord-mayor and the corporation
	of London, to impress the public
	with deeper convictions of its importance,
	witnessed the indestructible property of
	the structure on the 110th anniversary
	of the commencement of the great fire of
	London. Yet the invention sunk into
	obscurity, and few records remain of it
	except the pompous obelisk and the wreck
	of this house.</p>

	<p>It merits observation, that in modern-built
	<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"> </a>Houses taste or accident has effected
	sufficient security against fires without
	any special preventives. Flame is only
	ungovernable when in its ascent it meets
	with combustible materials. Heat, as the
	principle of expansion, rarefies and volatilizes
	all bodies; and then, as the heavier
	give place to the lighter, so bodies subject
	to its action ascend, and carry up with
	them the principle, matter, or action of
	heat. A chief object therefore of man’s
	policy in economizing fire, in subduing it
	to his use, and in governing its decomposing
	and destructive powers, should be
	to prevent its finding fuel in the ascent.
	No connected timbers ought therefore to
	join an inferior floor with a superior, so
	that, if one floor were on fire, its feeble
	lateral combustion might easily be extinguished
	with a mop and a pail of water,
	provided no train of combustibles were
	extended to the floor above. Such is the
	language of philosophy, and such the
	slight process of reason, by attending to
	which the habitations of men may at all
	<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"> </a>times be secured against the calamity of
	fire. How absurd however was the construction
	of our houses till within the last
	twenty or thirty years! Wooden staircases,
	exposed wooden balusters, and
	wainscotted walls, coated with paints composed
	of oil and turpentine, and put together
	more like a train of combustibles,
	than the habitations of beings calling themselves
	rational! The taste of modern architecture
	has, however, corrected the evil;
	and stone staircases, iron balusters, plastered
	walls, and lofty rooms, contribute to
	cut off the communication, though a fire
	may have seized on a flooring, or on any articles
	of furniture. This security might however
	be further increased by more strictly
	regarding the principle; by cutting off
	all contact between floor and floor,
	made by wooden pilasters, window-shutters,
	&amp;c.; by the more liberal introduction
	of iron; and by the occasional use of
	Hartley’s iron or copper sheets.</p>

	<p>By analogous reasoning it is suggested
	to us, that, if those females whose clothes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"> </a>have taken fire, and whose head, throat,
	breasts, and arm-pits, are consequently
	exposed to the increasing intensity of an
	ascending flame, were instantly to throw
	themselves into an horizontal position,
	their vital parts would not only not be
	affected, but the lateral flame would be
	so trifling as to be easily and safely extinguished.
	What in human life can exceed
	in horror, the circumstance of a
	woman in full health, often in the middle
	of her friends and family, being roasted
	alive by combustibles fastened to her person,
	from which it is impossible to escape
	till her most sensitive parts have been reduced
	to a cinder! What crime ever perpetrated
	by human turpitude could have
	warranted a more dreadful fate! What
	demons, contriving mischief and torments,
	could have invented a combination of
	miseries so terrible and heart-rending?
	The decorations of beauty—the gratification
	of pride—even the humble means of
	health and comfort, are thus rendered
	the unmerciful instruments of the keenest
	<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"> </a>sufferings, the most frightful sudden deaths,
	and the most dismal domestic tragedies!
	Yet the entire evil arises from the principle
	of the ascent of all heat; from the
	flame meeting in that ascent with fresh
	fuel to feed on, by which its intensity is
	<ins id="fix_5" title="was ‘progresssively’">progressively</ins> augmented; and then acting
	at its summit on the head, throat,
	and sensitive vital parts of the agonized
	victim. The remedy therefore is simply
	to lie down, when the roaring flame of
	several feet high will be so reduced that
	it may be put out with the hands, with
	the other parts of the garments, or by any
	extraneous covering.</p>

	<p>About a hundred yards from this fire-proof
	house, stands the Telegraph which
	communicates with Chelsea, and forms
	part of the chain from the Admiralty to
	Portsmouth and Plymouth. I learnt that
	there are twelve stations between London
	and Portsmouth, and thirty-one between
	London and Plymouth, of which eight
	are part of the Portsmouth line till they
	separate in the New Forest. Another
	<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"> </a>chain, extending from London to Yarmouth,
	contains nineteen stations; and
	another from London to Deal contains ten
	stations; making in the whole system sixty-four
	telegraphs. The distances average
	about eight miles, yet some of them are
	twelve or fourteen miles; and the lines
	are often increased by circuits, for want of
	commanding heights. In the Yarmouth
	line particularly, the chain makes a considerable
	detour to the northward.</p>

	<p>After about twenty years’ experience,
	they calculate on about two hundred
	days on which signals can be transmitted
	throughout the day; about sixty others on
	which they can pass only part of the day,
	or at particular stations; and about one
	hundred days in which few of the stations
	can see the others. The powers of
	the stations in this respect are exceedingly
	various. The station in question is generally
	rendered useless during easterly
	winds by the smoke of London, which
	fills the valley of the Thames between this
	spot and Chelsea hospital; or more commonly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"> </a>between the shorter distance of the
	Admiralty and Chelsea. Dead flats are
	found to be universally unfavourable; and
	generally stations are useless nearly in
	the proportion of the miles of dead flat
	looked over. On the contrary, stations
	between hill and hill, looking across a valley,
	or series of valleys, are mostly clear;
	and water surfaces are found to produce
	fewer obscure days than land in any situation.
	The period least favourable of
	the same day is an hour or two before
	and after the sun’s passage of the meridian,
	particularly on dead levels, where the play
	of the sun’s rays on the rising exhalations
	renders distant vision exceedingly obscure.
	The tranquillity of the morning and evening
	are ascertained to be the most favourable
	hours for observation.</p>

	<p>A message from London to Portsmouth
	is usually transmitted in about fifteen
	minutes; but, by an experiment tried for
	the purpose, a single signal has been transmitted
	to Plymouth and back again in three
	minutes, which by the Telegraph route is at
	<a class="pagenum" id="page144" title="144"> </a>at least five hundred miles. In this instance,
	however, notice had been given to make
	ready, and every captain was at his post to
	receive and return the signals. The progress
	was at the rate of one hundred and
	seventy miles in a minute, or three miles
	per second, or three seconds at each station;
	a rapidity truly wonderful! The
	number of signals produced by the English
	telegraph is sixty-three—by which they represent
	the ten digits, the letters of the
	alphabet, many generic words, and all the
	numbers which can be expressed by sixty-three
	variations of the digits. The signals
	are sufficiently various to express any three
	or four words in twice as many changes of
	the shutters.</p>

	<p>The observers at these telegraphs are
	not expected to keep their eye constantly
	at the glass, but look only every five minutes
	for the signal to make ready. The
	telescopes are Dolland’s Achromatics, at
	which one would wonder, if every thing
	done for governments were not converted
	into a job. The intention should have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"> </a>been to enable the observer to see the
	greatest number of hours; consequently
	the light should be intercepted by the
	smallest quantity of glass. Dollond’s achromatics
	contain, however, six lenses, and
	possess no recommendation but their enlarged
	field, and their freedom from prismatic
	colours in that field; points of no
	consequence in looking through a fixed
	glass at a fixed and circumscribed object.
	The field of the Galilean telescope is quite
	large enough, and, having but two lenses,
	one of which is a thin concave, it exhibits
	the object with greater brightness, and
	therefore ought to have been preferred
	for this purpose. It seems strange also,
	that, to ease the operator, it has never been
	contrived to exhibit the fixed spectrum
	on the principle of a portable camera, so
	that, without wearying the eye, the changes
	of the distant telegraph might have been
	exhibited on a plain surface, and seen
	with both eyes like the leaf of a book.
	The application of optical instruments,
	between a fixed station and fixed object,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"> </a>ought to have been made in an appropriate
	manner, and not influenced by the
	practices which prevail in regard to moveable
	telescopes for various objects.</p>

	<p>I have long thought that a system of
	telegraphs for domestic purposes would
	constitute one perfection of civilization in
	any country. Multifarious are the occasions
	in which individual interests require
	that events should be communicated with
	telegraphic celerity. Shipping concerns
	alone would keep telegraphs constantly
	at work, between all the ports of the kingdom
	and Lloyd’s coffee-house; and commerce
	would be essentially served, if,
	during ’Change-hours at London, Bristol,
	Liverpool, Hull, and Glasgow, communications
	could be interchanged relative
	to the state of markets, purchases, sales,
	and other transactions of business. How
	convenient too would be such a rapid
	intercourse between London and country
	bankers, in regard to balances, advances,
	and money transactions; how desirable
	in law business between London and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"> </a>country practitioners; and how important
	in cases of bankruptcy or insolvency! In
	family concerns, notices of deaths, births,
	accidents, progressive sickness, &amp;c. it
	would often be deeply interesting. The
	state of elections, the issues of lawsuits,
	determinations of the legislature, questions
	for answers, and numberless events of
	more or less importance, would occur sufficient
	to keep telegraphs in constant requisition,
	and abundantly repay the cost of
	maintaining them. A guinea might be paid
	per hundred miles, for every five or six
	words, which, in matters of private concern,
	might, by pre-concert, be transmitted
	in cypher. Instead of sixty-four
	telegraphs, we might then require five
	hundred, and an establishment costing
	100,000<i>l.</i> per annum; yet five hundred
	messages and replies per day, between
	<ins id="fix_6" title="was ‘differents’">different</ins> parts of the kingdom, taken at
	2<i>l.</i> each, would in two hundred and fifty
	days produce 250,000<i>l.</i> or a net revenue
	of 150,000<i>l.</i>  But to achieve so vast
	a purpose, and to confer on men a species
	<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"> </a>of ubiquity, even if 50,000<i>l.</i> per annum
	were lost to the government, would it not be
	worth the sacrifice, thus to give to the people
	of England an advantage not possessed,
	and never likely to be possessed, by any
	other people on earth? What a triumph
	of civilization would be afforded by such
	an extension of the telegraphic system!
	The combinations of the <strong class="special_emphasis">TELESCOPE</strong> began
	what those of the <strong class="special_emphasis">TELEGRAPH</strong> would
	complete. United, they would produce
	a kind of <em>finite ubiquity</em>, rendering the intercourse
	of an industrious community independent
	of time and distance, and binding
	the whole in ties of self-interest, by
	means which could be achieved only in a
	high state of civilization through fortunate
	combinations of human art.</p>

	<p>As I looked around me from this eminence,
	a multitude of ideas, sympathies,
	and affections, vibrated within me, which
	it would be impossible or tedious to
	analyse. The organ of the Eye was
	here played upon like that of the Ear in
	a musical concert. Nor was it the sense
	<a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"> </a>alone which was touched by this visual
	harmony; but every chord and tone found
	a separate concord or discord, in innumerable
	associations and reminiscences.
	It was, in truth, a chorus to the eye, unattended
	by the noise and distraction produced
	by the laboured compositions of
	<em class="special_name">Handel</em>; while it filled the whole of its
	peculiar sense with an effect like one of
	the tender symphonies of <em class="special_name">Haydn</em>. It
	was a Panorama, better adapted, however,
	to a poet than a painter; for it had no
	foreground, no tangible objects for light
	and shade, nor any eminences which raise
	the landscape above an angle of six or
	eight degrees; yet, to a poet, how rich
	it was in associations—how endless in
	pictures for the imagination!</p>

	<p>The north and north-east were still obscured
	by the dingy, irregular, and dense
	Smoke issuing from the volcano of the Metropolis;
	and, in looking upon it, how difficult
	it was to avoid tracing the now mingled
	masses back to their several sources, considering
	the happiness or misery which they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"> </a>reflected from their respective fire-sides,
	and gaging the aspirations of hope, or the
	sighs of wretchedness, which a fertile
	imagination might conceive to be combined
	with this social atmosphere! Convenient
	alike to every condition of humanity,
	it might be considered as flowing
	at once from the dungeons of despairing
	convicts, the cellars and garrets of squalid
	poverty, the busy haunts of avarice, the
	waste of luxury, and the wantonness of
	wealth.</p>

	<p>Straight before me, the metropolis, like
	a devouring monster, exhibited its equivocal
	and meretricious beauties, its extensive
	manufactories, its a<em>spir</em>ing churches and
	towers, and other innumerable edifices.
	<em class="special_name">Westminster Abbey</em> stood prominent,
	at once reviving the recollection of
	its superstitious origin, and exciting deep
	veneration as the depository of the relics
	of so much renown. What topics for commentary,
	if they had not been recently exhausted
	in the classical stanzas of a <em class="special_name">Maurice</em>!
	St. <em class="special_name">Paul’s</em>, the monument of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"> </a>Wren, was but just visible through the
	haze, though the man at the Telegraph asserted,
	that he could sometimes tell the
	hour by its dial without the aid of a telescope!
	How characteristic is this structure
	become of the British metropolis, and how
	flat the mass of common spires and smoky
	chimneys would now seem without it! The
	Monument, recording the delusions of faction,
	and the Tower, with all its gloomy
	associations, were visible in the reach of
	the river. Of Churches there appeared
	a monotonous groupe; while the houses
	presented a dingy and misshapen mass,
	as uninteresting at the distance of seven
	miles as an ant-hill at the distance of seven
	feet. Indeed, any wretch capable of setting
	his foot upon an ant-hill, and of destroying
	it, because it made no palpable
	appeals to his sympathy, might at this
	distance, by parity of feeling, let fall a
	mill-stone on this great city, and extinguish
	in an instant the hopes and cares of its
	inhabitants. On this spot then I behold
	an assemblage of the greatest wonders of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"> </a>man’s creation, at a focal distance, which
	reduces them to the measure of an <strong class="special_emphasis">ANT-HILL</strong>;
	and still further off they would be
	diminished even to a <strong class="special_emphasis">POINT</strong>! Such is
	the estimate of the eye, nor is it heightened
	by that of the ear; for I was assured that
	during tranquil nights, particularly by listening
	near the ground, the confused hum
	of the vast British metropolis could here
	be compared only to the buz of a <strong class="special_emphasis">BEE-HIVE</strong>,
	or the sound of a <strong class="special_emphasis">CONCH</strong>! What
	a lesson do these considerations afford to
	the pride of man, whose egotism represents
	him to himself as the most important
	object of the infinite creation; for whose
	use, he asserts, all things were made, and
	to whom all things are subservient! It is,
	however, natural that the nearest object
	should fill the largest angle, whether viewed
	by the mind or the eye; though it is the
	business of wisdom and philosophy to correct
	such illusions of our intellectual or
	sensitive powers.</p>

	<p>Of the moral condition, and feelings,
	concentrated within a spot thus embraced
	<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"> </a>by a glance of the eye, how impossible
	to form an estimate! Supposing 900,000
	human beings are thus huddled together,
	in 150,000 houses, we may conclude, that
	100,000 will always be lying on the bed
	of sickness, and that 30,000 are constantly
	afflicted by mortal diseases, eighty
	of whom expire every day, or three in
	every hour! Of the 150,000 house-keepers,
	above 50,000 are racked by poverty,
	or by the dread of its approach;
	other 50,000 maintain a precarious independence;
	while the remaining 50,000
	enjoy comfort and happiness, chequered,
	however, by care and the conflict of human
	passions. The greater part of the first
	class are either already plunged, or predisposed
	to plunge, into vices and crimes
	unknown except in such a city; those of
	the second class maintain a virtuous
	struggle, but more frequently sink into the
	lower, than rise into the higher class;
	while, among the third class, there are
	found all degrees of virtue and worth,
	although mixed with an envious spirit of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"> </a>rivalry, and an indulgence in expense and
	luxury that greatly reduce the number of
	truly happy families.</p>

	<p>On the north, north-west, and east, I
	still beheld the signs of this overgrown
	metropolis in villages, which branch, like
	luxuriant shoots, on every side. And it
	was only on the south and south-west, in
	the swelling downs and in the charms of
	Box-hill, Leith-hill, and Dorking, that I
	could discover the unsophisticated beauties
	of nature, which seemed to mock the toils
	of man, in the contrast they afforded to
	the scene in the opposite direction. Yet
	men, who never receive instruction except
	through their own experience, flock
	in tens of thousands to share in the lottery
	presented to their ambition in great
	cities, where thousands perish while in pursuit
	of the prize, where other thousands
	obtain nothing but blanks and disappointments,
	and whence the tens who achieve
	their object, gladly escape to enjoy their
	wealth, free from the disturbance of city
	passions, amid the placid and unchangeable
	beauties of nature.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"> </a>In looking around me from the windows
	of Hartley’s Fire-house, it was impossible
	to avoid reflecting on the wretchedness of
	Want existing in the sooty metropolis, and
	the waste of Means in the uncultivated
	country immediately around me. I had
	just been sympathizing with the forlorn inhabitants
	of the workhouse at Wandsworth,
	at the distance of only a mile; and half a
	dozen other such receptacles of misery invited
	commiseration within equal distances,
	in other directions; yet a radius of a few
	hundred yards round this spot would have
	included as much unappropriated and useless
	land as might have sufficed to confer
	independence and plenty on their hopeless
	inmates! In the north-eastern direction,
	within a distance of ten miles, at
	least twenty thousand families might be
	discovered pining in squalid misery; though
	here I found myself in an unpeopled and
	uncultivated tract, nearly four miles square,
	and containing above fifteen thousand acres
	of good soil, capable of affording independent
	subsistence to half as many families!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"> </a>I could not help exclaiming against the
	perversity of reason—the indifference of
	power—the complication of folly—and
	the ascendancy of turpitude, which, separately
	or conjointly, continue to produce
	circumstances so cruel and preposterous!
	Let it be recorded, said I, to the eternal
	disgrace of all modern statesmen, of many
	hundreds of ambitious legislators, and of
	our scientific economists, that in this
	luxuriant county of Surrey, there still
	exist, without productive cultivation, no
	less than 25,000 acres of open commons;
	30,000 acres of useless parks, 48,000
	acres of heaths, and 30,000 acres of chalk
	hills, serving but to subsist a few herds of
	deer and cattle, and to grow some unproductive
	trees, though at the very instant
	10,000 families in the same county are
	dependent on the bounty of their respective
	parishes! Is this, said I, the vaunted
	age of reason? Are these the genuine
	fruits of civilization? Do such circumstances
	indicate the ascendency of benevolence?
	Do they not rather demonstrate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"> </a>that the principle of doing to others as
	we would be done unto, has little influence
	on the practices of our Statesmen
	and Legislators?</p>

	<p>I may be told, that the principle of
	enclosing waste lands has long been recognised
	in the prevailing system of economy,
	and that the Legislature is incessantly active
	in passing Bills for new enclosures. But,
	I ask, for whom, and for whose benefit,
	are these bills passed? Do they provide
	for the poor? Do they help those who
	require help? Do they, by augmenting the
	supply, make provisions cheaper? Do they
	increase the number of independent fire-sides?—Rather,
	do they not wantonly
	add to the means of monopolists? Do
	they not give where nothing is wanted,
	however much may be coveted? Do they
	not add to the number of vassals, and
	diminish the number of freemen? Do
	they not abridge the scanty means of the
	poor in the free use of their bare-cropt
	commons? And do they not transfer those
	means to others who do not want them,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"> </a>and who, without the aid of new laws
	could never have enjoyed them?</p>

	<p>Yet does reason afford no alternative?
	Is benevolence forced to prefer barren
	heaths from which cottagers may derive
	scanty meals, merely because those who
	have the power fail to reconcile the rights
	©f others who want, with the benefit of the
	whole community? Is our wisdom confined
	in so narrow a circle? Has nature
	provided abundance, and do we create insuperable
	bars to its enjoyment? Is such
	the line of demarcation between the selfish
	ordinances of man, and the wise dispensations
	of Providence?</p>

	<p>Let me recommend our legislators for
	once to put their greedy, covetous, and
	inordinate Selves out of consideration.
	The poor may not be qualified to plead
	their rights, except by acts of rioting; but
	let them find clamorous advocates in the
	consciences of some of their law-makers. In
	spite, then, of the fees of parliament, I exhort
	the Legislature to pass a <strong class="special_emphasis">GENERAL
	ENCLOSURE BILL</strong>, not such a one, however,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"> </a>as would be recommended by the
	illustrious Board of Agriculture, but founded
	on such principles as might appropriately
	confer on it the title of <strong class="special_emphasis">A BILL
	FOR THE EXTINCTION OF WANT</strong>!</p>

	<p>In discussing and enacting its provisions,
	let it be borne in mind, that the surface
	of the earth, like the atmosphere in which
	we breathe, and the light in which we
	see, is the natural and common patrimony
	of man. Let it be considered, that by
	nature we are tillers of the soil, and that
	all the artifices of society, and the employments
	of towns, are good and desirable in
	the degree only in which they promote
	the comforts of the country. Let it
	be felt, that the 10,000 destitute families
	in this county of Surrey, and the half
	million in England and Wales, are so,
	merely because servitude or manufactures
	have failed to sustain them; and that
	they require, in consequence, the free use
	of the means presented by nature for their
	subsistence. In fine, let it be considered,
	that the unappropriated wastes are a national
	<a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"> </a>stock, fortunately in reserve as a
	provision for the increasing numbers of
	destitute; and that no more is required
	of the law than to arrange and economize
	the distribution, consistently with the wants
	of some, and the rights of all.</p>

	<p>I indulged myself in a pleasing reverie
	on this subject, while I rambled from the
	spot where it originated towards an adjacent
	house, in which died the late
	Mr. <em class="special_name">Pitt</em>, a man who had the opportunity
	of executing that which I have the power
	only to speculate upon, and who, though
	resident in this tract, was blind to its capabilities.
	Ah! thought I, perhaps in a less
	selfish age, this very heath, and all the
	adjoining heaths, waste tracts, and commons,
	from Bushy to Wimbledon, and
	from Barnes to Kingston, may be covered
	with cottages, each surrounded by its two
	or three acres of productive garden, orchard,
	and paddock! The healthful and
	happy inhabitants, emerged from the workhouses,
	the gaols, the cellars, the stews,
	the St. Giles’s, the loathsome courts,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"> </a>alleys, and lanes of the metropolis, would
	have reason to return thanksgivings to the
	wise Legislature, who had thus restored
	them to the condition of men, and enabled
	them to exhibit the moral effects of the
	change. Such, in the opinion of the
	writer, would be a radical cure for several
	of the complicated and deep-rooted diseases
	which now afflict British society;
	at least, it is a remedy without cost or
	sacrifice; and, as such, an homage due
	from affluence and power to indigence
	and misfortune. Such a plan would draw
	from the over-peopled towns, that destitute
	portion of the population, whose means
	of living have been reduced or superseded
	by shoals of adventurers from the country.
	It would render workhouses useless, except
	for the vicious or incorrigibly idle; would
	diminish the poor-rates, and deprive the
	inmates of gaols of the powerful excuse
	afforded to crime by the hopeless and
	galling condition of poverty.</p>

	<p>The house in which that darling of
	Fame, the late Mr. <em class="special_name">Pitt</em>, lived a few
	<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"> </a>years, and terminated his career, is a modest
	and irregularly-built mansion, surrounded
	by a few acres of pleasure-ground,
	and situated about a quarter of a mile
	from the paling of Richmond Park. My
	curiosity led me to visit the chamber in
	which this minister died, to indulge in the
	vivid associations produced by the contemplation
	of remarkable localities. I seated
	myself in a chair near the spot where
	stood the couch on which he took his
	eternal slumber. I fancied, at the instant,
	that I still saw the severe visage
	and gaunt figure of the minister standing
	between the Treasury-bench and the table
	of the House of Commons, turning around
	to his admiring partisans, and filling the
	ear of his auditory with the deep full
	tones of a voice that bespoke a colossal
	stature. Certain phrases which he used to
	parrot still vibrated on my brain: “Bonaparte,
	the child and champion of Jacobinism,”—“the
	preservation of social
	order in Europe,”—“the destruction of
	whatever is dear to our feelings as Englishmen,”—“the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"> </a>security of our religion,
	liberties, and property,”—“indemnity for
	the past and security for the future,” with
	which he used to bewilder or terrify the
	plain country gentlemen, or the youths
	from Eton, Oxford, or Cambridge, who
	constitute a majority of that House. His
	success in exciting the passions of such
	senators in favour of discord and war, his
	lavish expenditure of the public money in
	corrupting others, and his insincerity in
	whatever he professed for the public benefit,
	rendered him through life the subject
	of my aversion: but, in this chamber,
	reduced to the level of ordinary men, and
	sinking under the common infirmities of
	humanity, his person, character, and premature
	decease became objects of interesting
	sympathy. Perhaps he did what he
	thought best; or, rather, committed the
	least possible evil amidst the contrariety
	of interests and passions in which he and
	all public men are placed. This, however,
	is but a poor apology for one who
	lent his powerful talents to wage wars that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"> </a>involved the happiness of millions, who
	became a willing firebrand among nations,
	and who, as a tool or a principal, was
	foremost in every work of contemporary
	mischief. The love of office, and a passion
	for public speaking, were, doubtless,
	the predominant feelings of his soul. To
	gratify the former, he became the instrument
	of others, and thence the sophistry
	of his eloquence and the insincerity of his
	character; while, in the proud display of
	his acknowledged powers as an orator, he
	was stimulated not less by vanity, than by
	the virtuous rivalry of Fox. As a financier,
	he played the part of a nobleman
	who, having estates, worth 20,000<i>l.</i> per
	annum, mortgages them to enable him to
	spend 100,000<i>l.</i> and then plumes himself
	on his power, with the same freeholds,
	to make a greater figure than his
	predecessors. But, except for the lesson
	which he afforded to nations never to
	trust their fortunes in the hands of inexperienced
	statesmen, why do I gravely
	discuss the measures and errors of one
	<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"> </a>who did not live long enough to prove
	his genuine character? No precocity of
	talents, no mechanical splendour of eloquence,
	can stand in the place of judgment
	founded on Experience. At forty-six, Pitt
	would have begun, like all other men of
	the same age, to correct the errors of his
	past life; but, being then cut off—<strong class="special_emphasis">HIS
	STORY IS INCOMPLETE</strong>! He had within
	him the elements of a great man, yet they
	were called into action before their powers
	were adjusted and matured; and the world
	suffered by experiments made in teaching
	himself, instead of profiting by the union
	of his experience with his intellectual energies.
	He was an actor on the stage, while
	he ought to have been in the closet studying
	his part; his errors, therefore, merit
	pity, and those alone are to be blamed for
	them who made a dishonest use of his precocious
	powers.</p>

	<p>I learnt in the immediate vicinity, that
	he was much respected, and was a kind
	master to his domestics. A person, who
	a little before his death was in this room,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"> </a>told that it was heated to a very high
	and oppressive temperature; and that the
	deep voice of the dying minister, as he
	asked his valet a question, startled this
	visitor, who had been unused to it. He
	died calmly, and apparently under none of
	those political perturbations which, at the
	period, were mistakenly ascribed to his last
	moments. The Bishop of Lincoln, who
	acted the part of his friend and confessor,
	published an interesting account of his decease,
	the accuracy of which has never
	been questioned.</p>

	<p>It being my intention, on leaving this
	spot, to descend the hill to Barnes-Elms,
	and to proceed by that once classical resort
	through Barnes and Mortlake to Kew,
	I left Mr. Pitt’s house on the right, and
	crossed the common to the retired village
	of Roehampton.</p>

	<p>Opposite to me were the boundaries
	of Richmond Park; and, little more than
	half a mile from the house of Pitt, in one
	of the most picturesque situations of that
	beautiful demesne, stands the elegant
	<a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"> </a>mansion which was presented, it is said,
	to the then favourite minister, Mr. <em class="special_name">Addington</em>.
	Thus it appears, that two
	succeeding ministers of England, in an age
	reputed enlightened, lived in a district
	possessing the described capabilities for removing
	the canker-worm of poverty, yet
	neither of them displayed sufficient energy
	or wisdom to apply the remedy to the
	disease. I am not, however, arrogant
	enough to adduce my plans as tests of the
	patriotism of statesmen; but I venture to
	appeal from the judgment of this age to
	that of the next, whether any minister
	could deserve the reputation of sagacity,
	who, in an over-peopled country, in which
	large portions of the inhabitants of the
	towns were destitute of subsistence, lived
	themselves in the midst of waste tracts
	capable of feeding the whole, and yet took
	no measures nor made a single effort to
	apply the waste to their wants. If the
	same facts were related of a ruler in any
	foreign country, or in any remote age,
	what would be the inference of a modern
	<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"> </a>English reader in regard to his genuine
	benevolence, wisdom, or patriotism?</p>

	<p>I am desirous of advancing no opinions
	which can be questioned, yet I cannot
	refrain from mentioning, in connexion
	with this wooded horizon, my surprise
	that peculiar species of trees have not yet
	<ins id="errata_2" title="was ‘formed’">found</ins> a line of distinction between inhabited
	and civilized, and uninhabited and
	barbarous countries. Does not the principle
	which converts a heath into pasturage
	and corn-fields, or a collection of furze-bushes
	or brambles into a fruit-garden, demand
	that all unproductive trees should give
	way as fast as possible, in a civilized country,
	to other trees which afford food to the inhabitants?
	Are there not desolate countries
	enough in which to grow trees for the
	mere purposes of timber? Are there not
	soils and situations even in England, where
	none but timber-trees can grow? And is
	not the timber of many fruit-trees as useful
	as the timber of many of the lumber-trees
	which now encumber our soil? It is
	true, that, when wood constituted the fuel
	<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"> </a>of the country, the growth of lumber-tree
	was essential to the comforts of the inhabitants;
	but that is no longer our condition.
	I conceive, therefore, that a wise
	and provident government, which, above
	all other considerations, should endeavour
	to feed the people at the least cost and
	labour, ought to allow no lumber-trees to
	encumber the soil until fruit-trees were
	planted sufficient to supply the inhabitants
	with as much fruit as their wants or luxuries
	might require. The primary object
	of all public economy should be to saturate,
	a civilized country with food. Why should
	not pear and walnut-trees supply the
	place of oaks, elms, and ash; the apple,
	plum, cherry, damson, and mulberry, that
	of the birch, yew, and all pollards? It
	would be difficult, I conceive, to adduce
	a reason to the contrary; and none which
	could weigh against the incalculable advantages
	of an abundant supply of wholesome
	provisions in this cheap form. Nor
	does my plan terminate with the ornaments
	of forests, parks, and hedge-rows;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"> </a>but I ask, why many hedges themselves
	might not, in like manner, consist of gooseberry
	and currant trees in their most luxuriant
	varieties, intermingled with raspberries,
	nuts, filberts, bullaces, &amp;c.? Not
	to give this useful and productive face to
	a country, appears to me to be shutting our
	eyes to the light; to prefer the useless to the
	useful; to be so inconsistent as to expect
	plenty where we take no means to create
	it; or, in other words; to sow tares and
	desire to gather wheat, or expect grapes
	where we have planted only thorns. Let
	us, even in this point, condescend to borrow
	a lesson from an illustrious, though oft
	despised, neighbour, who, it appears by
	the evidence of all travellers, has taken
	care that the roads and hedges of France
	should be covered with productive fruit
	trees. If such also were the condition of
	Britain, how insignificant would become
	the anxious questions about a Corn Bill,
	or the price of any single article of food.
	We should then partake of the ample
	stores provided, and perhaps contemplated,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"> </a>by our forefathers, when they rendered
	indigenous the fruit-trees of warmer climates;
	and, feeling less solicitude in regard
	to the gross wants of animal subsistence,
	we should be enabled to employ our faculties
	more generally in improving our moral
	and social condition. We should thus
	extend the principle, and reduce the general
	purpose of all productive cultivation
	to an analogous economy, enjoying the
	fullest triumph which our climate would
	admit, of the fortunate combinations of
	human art over the inaptitude and primitive
	barbarity of nature.</p>

	<p>The sequestered village of Roehampton
	consists of about thirty or forty small
	houses, in contact; and of a dozen monastic
	mansions, inhabited by noblemen
	and well-accredited traders. Each of the
	latter being surrounded by twenty or thirty
	acres of garden and pleasure-grounds, and
	bounded by high brick walls, which in
	every direction line the roads, Roehampton
	presents to a stranger a most cheerless
	aspect. As the plantations are old, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"> </a>full-grown oaks, elms, and chesnuts, within
	the walls, add to the gloom, and call
	to mind those ages of mental paralysis
	when Druids and Monks gave effect to
	their impostures by similar arrangements.</p>

	<p>They serve to prove how slavishly men
	are the creatures of imitation; how seldom,
	in how few things, and by what small
	gradations genius gives a novel direction
	to their practices! When this island was
	overrun with beasts of prey, in the shape
	of quadrupeds, and lawless bipeds, the
	baron and the man of wealth found it
	necessary to shut themselves within castellated
	mansions and circumvallated domains;
	and hence the vulgar association
	between such establishments and a presumed
	high rank in their occupiers. The
	state of the country and of modern society
	renders them no longer essential to security;
	yet they are maintained as the effect
	of a false association; and half the stimulus
	of avarice would be lost without the
	anticipated grandeur of a monastic establishment,
	buried in the centre of a wood,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"> </a>and cut off from the cheerful world, and
	the healthful circulation of the atmosphere,
	by damp and mouldering walls!
	It does not signify how apparently dull,
	how unappropriate to fixed habits, how
	unvarying the inanimate scene, how much
	the inmates may be visited by low fevers,
	agues, rheumatisms, and pulmonary affections;
	the manor-house, or the ancient
	monastery, which has for ages been the
	residence of nobility, becomes, in consequence,
	the meed of wealth, and the goal
	of vulgar hope, to be patiently endured,
	however little it may be enjoyed! Pride
	will feed upon the possession; and, if
	that master-passion be gratified, minor inconveniences
	will have little weight in
	making the election.</p>

	<p>I confess it—and I make the declaration
	in the humble form of a confession,
	in the hope that those who think I have
	sinned, will be led to forgive my error—that
	I could not help thinking that the
	inhabitants of the humble cottages by the
	way-side, whose doors stood wide open,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"> </a>whose children were intermingling and
	playing before them, whose society is restricted
	by no formal reserve, whose
	means depend on their industry, <strong class="special_emphasis">WHO
	HAVE NOT LEISURE TO BE UNHAPPY</strong>,
	who cannot afford to stimulate their appetites
	so as to enfeeble themselves by the
	languor of repletion, or disease themselves
	by the corruptions of plethora, and who
	would have no wants if the bounties of nature
	were not cruelly intercepted—I could
	not help feeling, that such unsophisticated
	beings experience less care, less self-oppression,
	less disease, more gaiety of
	heart, more grateful sympathy, and more
	even of the sense of well-being, than the
	artificial and constrained personages who,
	however amiable, and however free from
	the common vices of rank and wealth, inhabit
	the adjacent mansions, with all their
	decorations of art, and all their luxuries
	of hot-houses, graperies, pineries, ice-houses,
	temples, grottoes, hermitages, and
	other fancies, with which power hopes to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"> </a>cheat itself into enjoyment, as an apology
	for its insatiable monopolies.</p>

	<p>The inefficacy of wealth to raise man
	above his cares and mortal feelings has,
	however, of late years been so honestly
	conceded, that the rich have begun, at least
	in external appearance, to assume the condition
	of the poor. Hence, few of those
	mansions are built, or even restored, on
	whose gloomy character I have been remarking;
	and our proudest nobility now
	condescend to inhabit the cheerful, though
	humble, Cottage. They find, or by their
	practices they seem to prove they have
	found, that the nearest approach to happiness,
	is the nearest approach to the
	humility of poverty! The thatched roof—the
	tiny flower-garden—the modest wicket—the
	honey-suckle bower—the cleanly
	dairy—the poultry yard—the dove-cote—the
	piggery—and the rabbit-pen,—comprehended
	under the names of the <em>Ferme
	Ornée</em>, or <em>Cottage Ornée</em>, now constitute
	the favourite establishments of those who
	found so few comforts in marble porticoes,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"> </a>in walls hung with the works of the Gobelins
	or the Italian school, in retinues of
	servants, and extensive parks. What a
	concession of pride—what a homage rendered
	to nature—what a consolation to
	discontented poverty—what a warning to
	inconsiderate ambition!</p>

	<p>Yet our taste ought to be governed by
	our reason and our wants. Large families
	require large houses; it is therefore the
	business of good taste to combine capacity
	with cheerfulness. Nothing, at the same
	time, within the sphere of human enjoyment,
	equals the delight afforded by well-planned
	garden-grounds; and it is consequently
	the duty of the artist to unite
	these with the cheerful family mansion.
	Here, then, begin the obtrusion, and the
	alledged necessity of those boundary walls,
	against which I have been protesting. No
	such thing—such walls, thanks to the genius
	and good taste of a <em class="special_name">Pilton</em>, are become
	unnecessary. We may now, without
	walls, have secure boundaries—we
	may keep out trespassers without excluding
	<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"> </a>the fresh air—and we may circumscribe
	our limits without diminishing our external
	prospects. In that case, how different in
	appearance would be this village of Roehampton—how
	much more tolerable to its
	residents—how far more healthy—and how
	enchanting to strangers,—if, instead of
	monotonous brick-walls, the boundaries
	were formed by the magical fences of
	<em class="special_name">Pilton</em>, allowing the free passage of the
	solar rays and the vital air, reciprocating
	delightful prospects from plantation to
	plantation, and adding the essential charms
	of variety to the pleasures of possession.</p>

	<p>The first house in the lane is the
	classical seat of the Earl of Besborough,
	enriched with specimens of ancient statuary
	from Italy and Greece, and with
	exquisite pictures of the Italian, Flemish,
	and Dutch schools. Adjoining, is the
	highly finished residence of the Marchioness
	of Downshire; and farther on,
	are the superb mansions of Mr. Gosling,
	a banker; and of Mr. Dyer. In the lane
	leading to Richmond Park, across which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"> </a>there is a delightful drive to the Star-and-Garter,
	is the charming residence of Mr.
	Temple; and, farther north, is the splendid
	mansion of the late Mr. Benjamin Goldsmid,
	since become the property of Lord
	Chief Justice Ellenborough.</p>

	<p>Various associations in regard to its
	first and its present proprietor, drew my
	attention to the site last mentioned. I
	had not leisure to examine its interior,
	but the exterior is in the best style of such
	edifices. The house looks to the north-west,
	and, being the last in the descent of
	the hill, commands an uninterrupted prospect
	over the country towards Harrow and
	Elstree. The front consists of a superb
	portico of white marble columns, in the
	Corinthian order; but in other respects
	the house is not very striking, and its
	dimensions are inconsiderable. The lawn
	falls pleasingly towards a piece of water,
	and on its eastern side is a fascinating
	drive of half-a-mile, terminated by a pair of
	cast-iron gates of singular beauty. But
	the object which more particularly called
	<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"> </a>to mind the unbounded wealth of its former
	proprietor, is a subterraneous way to the
	kitchen-garden and lawns on the opposite
	side the road. It is finished with gates
	resembling those of a fortified castle, with
	recesses and various ornaments, all of Portland-stone;
	and on the near side is a spacious
	hermitage.</p>

	<p>In this house the late Mr. B. Goldsmid
	resided, while he balanced the
	finances of the British empire, and raised
	for the Pitt Administration those vast sums
	which enabled it to retard the progress
	of liberal opinions during the quarter of a
	century! After the instance of a Goldsmid,
	the reputed wealth of a Crœsus sinks
	into insignificance. The Jew broker, year
	after year, raised for the British government
	sums of twenty and thirty millions,
	while the Lydian monarch, with all his
	boasted treasures, would have been unable
	to make good even the first instalment!
	Such, however, is the talisman of
	credit in a commercial and banking country!
	In addition to their own funds, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"> </a>to the funds permanently confided to their
	prudence from foreign correspondents,
	amounting to three or four millions, the
	brothers, Benjamin and Abraham Goldsmid,
	commanded for many years, from
	day to day, the floating balances of the
	principal London bankers; and they were
	among bankers, what bankers are among
	private traders. It was their daily practice
	to visit most of the bankers’ counting-houses,
	and address them briefly—“Will
	you borrow or lend fifty thousand to-day?”—According
	to the answer, the sum
	required was deposited on the spot, or
	carried away—no memorandum passed,
	and a simple entry in their respective
	books served merely to record the hour
	when the sum was to be repaid, with its
	interest. With such credit, and such
	ready means, it is not to be wondered
	that the Goldsmids commanded the wealth
	of the world; nor that their services were
	courted by an administration which never
	suffered its projects to languish while these
	brokers could raise money on exchequer-bills!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"> </a>A paper circulation is, however, a
	vortex, out of which neither individuals
	nor governments ever escaped without calamity,
	and from whose fatal effects the prudence
	and integrity of these worthy men
	served as no adequate protection. A
	whisper that they had omitted to repay a
	banker’s loan at the very hour agreed,
	first shook their credit; while some changes
	in the financial arrangements of government,
	and the malignity of some envious
	persons, (for rivals they could have none,)
	led to a fatal catastrophe in regard to one
	brother in this house; afterwards to a
	similar tragedy in regard to the other, at
	Merton; and finally to the breaking-up of
	their vast establishment. Whether their
	exertions were beneficial to the country
	may be doubted; this, however, is certain,
	that the Goldsmids were men of a princely
	spirit, who possessed a command of wealth,
	during the twelve or fifteen years of their
	career, beyond any example in the domestic
	history of nations. In this house
	Benjamin repeatedly gave banquets, worthy
	<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"> </a>of his means, to the chief branches of
	the royal family, and most of the nobility
	and gentry of the realm: and it deserves
	to be mentioned, to his honour, that he
	was the constant patron of literature and
	of distressed men of letters. Abraham, in
	like manner, gave royal entertainments,
	and was the unshaken friend of Lord
	Nelson, and of the interesting widow of
	Sir William Hamilton, whose premature
	death in a state of poverty, was a consequence
	of the misfortunes of her generous
	protector.</p>

	<p>Adjoining the splendid iron gates which
	lead into these grounds, stands a house
	memorable for the violent effects of a
	thunder storm. The records of the year
	1780 probably describe the details of
	these phenomena; but, happening to meet,
	on the premises, with a man who had witnessed
	the whole, I collected from him the
	following particulars:—He related, that,
	after a pleasant day in September, a sudden
	storm of thunder and lightning, accompanied
	by rain and wind, took place,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"> </a>which lasted not more than ten or fifteen
	minutes. That, believing “the world at
	an end, his master and family went to
	prayers;” but, on the noise abating, they
	found that their extensive barn, with various
	out-buildings, had been entirely carried
	away. Parts of them were found, on
	the following morning, on Barnes Common,
	at the distance of a mile, while other
	parts were scattered around the fields. He
	related also, that two horses which were
	feeding in a shed, were driven, with their
	manger, into the ditch on the opposite
	side of the lane; and that a loaded cart
	was torn from the shafts and wheels, and
	wafted into an adjoining field. A crop of
	turnips were mowed down as with a
	scythe, and a double row of twenty or
	thirty full-grown elms, which stood on
	the sides of the lane, were torn up by
	the roots. One man was killed in the
	barn, and six others were wounded, or so
	severely shocked as to require relief in an
	hospital.</p>

	<p>Having never before met with a case of
	such total destruction from the action of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"> </a>electricity, I considered these facts as too
	interesting to be lost. It may be worth
	while to add, in elucidation, that the mischief
	was doubtless occasioned by an
	ascending ball; or rather, as the action
	extended over a surface of three or four
	acres, by a succession of ascending balls.<a href="#footnote_3" id="fnm3" title="I use the word ball..." class="fnmarker">3</a>
	The conducting substances were dry or
	imperfect, and thence the violence of the
	explosions. This is neither the time nor
	place to speak of the erroneous views
	still entertained of a power which is only
	known to us by experiments made within
	a non-conducting atmosphere, whose antagonist
	properties, or peculiar relations to it,
	afford results which are mistakenly ascribed
	to the power itself, as properties <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</em>.
	Are we warranted in calling in an independent
	<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"> </a>agent to account for phenomena
	which are governed in their appearances
	by every different <em>surface</em> in connexion
	with which they are exhibited, and which
	can be produced only in certain classes of
	<em>surfaces</em> in fixed relations to other <em>surfaces</em>?
	Can the cause of phenomena, of
	which we have no knowledge but in the
	antagonist relations of <em>surfaces</em> called conducting
	and non-conducting, be philosophically
	considered but as <em>the mere
	effect</em> of those nicely-adjusted relations?
	Can that power be said to be distinct
	from the inherent properties of various
	matter, which can never be exhibited except
	in contrast, as <em>plus</em> on one surface,
	and <em>minus</em> in another, or, if positive on
	A. necessarily and <ins id="fix_7" title="was ‘stimultaneously’">simultaneously</ins> negative
	on B.? Are the phenomena called
	<strong class="special_emphasis">LIGHT</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">HEAT</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">GRAVITATION</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">COHESION</strong>,
	<strong class="special_emphasis">ELECTRICITY</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">GALVANISM</strong>, and
	<strong class="special_emphasis">MAGNETISM</strong>, produced by different powers
	of nature, or by the action of one power
	on different bodies, or by the action of
	different bodies on one active power?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page186" title="186"> </a>Do not the phenomena appear constantly
	to accompany the same bodies, and are
	they not therefore occasioned by the qualities
	of the bodies? May not the different
	qualities of bodies be sufficient to explain
	the phenomena on the hypothesis of one
	active power? Is it necessary that the
	phenomena should be confined to particular
	bodies, if there are as many active
	fluids as phenomena? Is not the exact
	limitation of each set of phenomena to
	particular bodies conclusive evidence that
	the phenomena grow out of some antagonist
	qualities of those bodies? In fine,
	do not the varying powers calculated to
	produce the phenomena, consist of the
	varying qualities of bodies, and the varying
	circumstances in which they are placed
	in regard to each other; and may not the
	active power be fixed and always the
	same? Does not this conclusion best accord
	with the simplicity of nature? Is it
	probable that two active powers could be
	co-existent? May not the elasticity of a
	universal medium account for most of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"> </a>intricate phenomena of bodies? May not
	motion grow out of the vacuum between
	the atoms of that universal medium? May
	there not be set within set, each necessary
	to the motion of the other, till we approximate
	a plenum? May not certain
	varieties of these involved series of atoms
	constitute the several media which produce
	the several phenomena of matter?</p>

	<p>Prudence forbids me to extend these
	queries on subjects which will ever interest
	the speculative part of mankind, but
	on which it will be difficult, if not impossible,
	to arrive at certain and indubitable
	conclusions: as, however, I have been
	led into this digression by existing errors
	relative to Electricity, I may remark, in
	conclusion, that the phenomena produced
	by this power arise from the action of
	opposing surfaces through intervening
	media; that the excitement impels the surfaces
	towards each other; and that all the
	phenomena grow out of the motive quality
	of intervening bodies, whose surfaces are
	alternately attracted by the comprehending
	<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"> </a>excited surfaces, or out of the want
	of perfect smoothness in the opposing or
	excited surfaces. Electricity is in fact
	the phenomena of surfaces, growing out
	of the sole property of their mutual mechanical
	attractions, which attractions are
	governed by some necessary relations of
	the surfaces of the intervening media to
	the surfaces of the opposing conductors.</p>

	<p>At any rate, it is irrational to suppose
	that the <strong class="special_emphasis">CAUSE</strong> of <strong class="special_emphasis">CAUSES</strong> operates in
	the production of natural phenomena by
	the aid of such complicated machinery,
	and such involved powers, as men have
	forced into nature, for the purpose of
	accounting for affections on their senses, or
	effects of matter on matter; in the measure
	of which they have no standard but their
	sensitive powers and the undiscovered relations
	of the agent and patient. Would
	it not, on the contrary, be more consistent
	with the proper views of philosophy
	to dismiss all occult powers, which are so
	many signs of our ignorance or superstition,
	and to search for the <strong class="special_emphasis">SECONDARY
	<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"> </a>CAUSES</strong> of all phenomena, as well between
	the smallest as the largest masses,
	in the undeviating laws of <strong class="special_emphasis">ARITHMETIC</strong>,
	<strong class="special_emphasis">GEOMETRY</strong>, and <strong class="special_emphasis">MECHANICS</strong>; whose
	simplicity, sublimity, perfection, and immutability,
	accord with our deductions in
	regard to the attributes of an <strong class="special_emphasis">OMNISCIENT
	ARCHITECT</strong> and <strong class="special_emphasis">OMNIPOTENT
	DIRECTOR</strong> of the universe?</p>

	<p>This, however, is certain, that such catastrophes
	as those described could never
	occur, if the imperfect conductors of which
	our buildings are generally composed,
	were encompassed by more perfect conductors.
	The ridge of the roof of every
	house should be of metal; and, if that
	metallic ridge were connected with the
	leaden water-pipes, and by them continued
	into the ground, all buildings would be
	protected. A descending or an ascending
	ball would then find a conduit, by
	which to pass, or freely propagate its
	powers, without the violent effects that
	accompany its transition through air and
	other non-conductors. The rods of Franklin
	<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"> </a>are toys, which were ingeniously contrived
	in the infancy of this branch of
	science, but they ought now to be forgotten.</p>

	<p>Before I dismiss this interesting topic,
	I would ask whether the transmission of
	the power called <em>electric</em>, to a particular
	spot, does not always afford evidence,
	that at that spot there exists, beneath
	the surface of the earth, either a vein of
	metallic ore, a spring, or some other
	competent conductor, which the power
	called <em>electric</em> is seeking to reach, when
	the antagonist non-conductors exhibit
	their destructive phenomena? Does not
	the power or vacuum created by the
	change of volume in the aqueous vapour
	of the cloud, regard only the perfect conductors
	prepared to receive it, however
	deeply they may be concealed beneath
	the surface of the non-conducting or imperfectly-conducting
	soil and vegetable
	surface? If it were not so, would not the
	stroke always affect the higher objects, or
	prefer palpable conductors in moderately
	<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"> </a>elevated sites? In this instance 200 degrees
	of the horizon were more elevated
	than the place attacked, while the destruction
	proves that the superficies invited no
	accumulation here. Must not then the
	predisposing and operative cause have
	existed beneath the surface; and, hence,
	may not the selection of lightning, in most
	cases where it prefers lower sites, afford
	evidence of the existence of metallic
	strata, of springs, or other conducting
	surfaces, the discovery of which, by such
	natural test, may sometimes be important
	to the owner of the soil?</p>

	<p>The bottom of Roehampton-lane joins
	the road which leads from Putney and
	Wandsworth to Richmond. Here I came
	again upon the same alluvial Flat which I
	left when I ascended from Wandsworth
	to Putney-heath, having since passed a
	corner of the undulating high land on
	which stand Wimbledon, its common,
	Roehampton, Richmond-park, and its
	lovely hill. A more interesting site of the
	same extent, is not perhaps to be found
	<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192"> </a>in the world. Its picturesque beauty, and
	its general advantages as a place of residence,
	are attested by the preference
	given to it by ministers and public men,
	who select it as a retreat from the cares
	of ambition. On this ridge Pitt, Tooke,
	Addington, Burdett, Goldsmid, and Dundas,
	were recent contemporary residents.
	Here, amid the orgies of the latter, were
	probably concerted many of those political
	projects which have unfortunately
	desolated the finest portions of Europe,
	for the wicked, yet vain, purpose of destroying
	Truth by the sword! In an adjoining
	domain, Tooke beguiled, in philological
	pastime, the evening of a life
	whose meridian had been employed in
	disputing, inch by inch, the overwhelming
	march of corrupt influence; while, as
	though it were for effect of light and
	shade, the spacious plain of Wimbledon
	served to display the ostentatious manœuvres
	of those servile agents of equivocal
	justice, whose permanent organization by
	an anti-human policy has been engrafted
	<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"> </a>on modern society, but whose aid would
	seldom or never be necessary, if the
	purposes of their employers accorded with
	the omnipotent influence of truth, reason,
	and justice.</p>

	<p>I was now on the border of Barnes
	Common, consisting of 500 acres of waste;
	and at a few paces eastward stands
	<em class="special_name">Barnes poor-house</em>! Yes!—in this
	enlightened country—in the vicinage of
	the residence of many boasted statesmen—stands
	a <strong class="special_emphasis">PARISH POOR-HOUSE ON A
	WASTE</strong>! The unappropriated means of
	plenty and independence surrounding a
	mansion of hopeless poverty, maintained
	by collections of nearly 4000<i>l.</i> per annum
	from the industrious parishioners! Lest
	readers in future ages should doubt the
	fact, the antiquary of the year 2500 is
	hereby assured,—that it stood at the angle
	of the Wandsworth and Fulham roads, at
	the perpendicular distance of a mile from
	the Thames, and by the side of the
	fashionable ride from London to Richmond!—Did
	so monstrous an incongruity
	<a class="pagenum" id="page194" title="194"> </a>never penetrate the heads or hearts of any
	of the high personages who daily pass it?
	Did it never occur to any of them that it
	would be more rational to convert the
	materials of this building into cottages,
	surrounded by two or three acres of
	the waste, by which the happiness of the
	poor and the interests of the public would
	be blended? Can any antiquated feudal
	right to this useless tract properly supersede
	the paramount claims of the poor and
	the public?—From respect to any such
	right, ought so great a libel on our political
	economy to be suffered to exist, as a receptacle
	for the poor in the middle of an
	uncultivated and unappropriated waste? To
	dwell further on so mortifying a proof of
	the fallibility of human wisdom may, however,
	pique the pride of those who enjoy
	the power to organize a better system:—I
	therefore forbear!</p>

	<p>These and other considerations prompted
	me to visit the interior. I found it
	clean and airy, but the best rooms were
	not appropriated to the poor. The master
	<a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"> </a>and matron were plain honest people,
	who, I have no doubt, do all the justice
	that is possible with a wretched pittance
	of 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per head per week. Should
	4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> remain to provide each with twenty-one
	meals, this is but two-pence half-penny
	per meal! Think of this, ye pampered
	minions of wealth, who gorge turtle
	at a guinea a pound, who <em>beastialize</em> yourselves
	with wine at a shilling a glass, and
	who wantonly devour a guinea’s worth of
	fruit after finishing a sumptuous dinner!—The
	guardians have judiciously annexed
	to the house an acre or two of ground for
	a garden, which is cultivated by the paupers,
	and supplies them with sufficient
	vegetables. This, though a faint approach
	to my plan, is yet sufficient to prove what
	the whole common would effect, if properly
	applied to the wants and natural
	claims of the poor. It is too often pretended
	that these wastes are incapable of
	cultivation—but the fertile appearance of
	enclosed patches constantly falsifies such
	selfish and malignant assertions.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page196" title="196"> </a>I visited the community of these paupers,
	consisting in this small parish of only
	thirty men, women, and children, in one
	large room. Among them were some disgusting-looking
	idiots, a class of objects
	who seem to be the constant nuisance of
	every poor-house.<a href="#footnote_4" id="fnm4" title="Since these observations..." class="fnmarker">4</a> How painful it must
	be to honest poverty to be brought into
	contact with such wretched creatures, who
	are often vicious, and, in their tricks and
	habits, always offensive and dirty. Surely,
	for the sake of these degraded specimens
	of our kind, as well as out of respect
	to the parish-poor, who have no choice
	but to live with them, every county ought
	to be provided with a special Asylum
	for idiots; whose purpose should be to
	smoothen their passage through life, and
	to render it as little noisome to others, and
	to one another, as possible.</p>

	<p>On leaving this poor-house, I crossed
	Barnes Common in a north-eastern direction,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"> </a>with a view to visit at Barnes-Elms
	the former residence of Jacob Tonson, the
	bookseller, and once the place of meeting
	of the famous Kit-Cat Club.</p>

	<p>On this Common, nature still appeared
	to be in a primeval and unfinished state.
	The entire Flat from the high ground to
	the Thames, is evidently a mere freshwater
	formation, of comparatively modern
	date, created out of the rocky ruins
	which the rains, in a series of ages, have
	washed from the high grounds, and further
	augmented by the decay of local vegetation.
	The adjacent high lands, being
	elevated above the action of the fresh
	water, were no doubt marine formations,
	created by the flowing of the sea during
	the four thousand years when the earth
	was last in its perihelion during our summer
	months; which was between twelve
	and seven thousand years since. The
	Flat or fresh-water formation, on which I
	was walking, still only approaches its completion;
	and the desiccated soil has not
	yet fully defined the boundaries of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"> </a>river. At spring-tides, particularly when
	the line of the moon’s apsides coincides
	with the syzygies, or when the ascending
	node is in the vernal equinox, or after
	heavy rains, the river still overflows its
	banks, and indicates its originally extended
	scite under ordinary circumstances.</p>

	<p>The state of transition also appears in
	marshes, bogs, and ponds, which, but for
	the interference of man, would many ages
	ago have been filled up with decayed forests
	and the remains of undisturbed vegetation.
	Rivers thus become agents of the <strong class="special_emphasis">NEVER-CEASING
	CREATION</strong>, and a means of
	giving greater equality to the face of the
	land. The sea, as it retired, either abruptly
	from some situations, or gradually
	from others, left dry land, consisting of
	downs and swelling hills, disposed in all
	the variety which would be consequential
	on a succession of floods and ebbs during
	several thousand years. These downs,
	acted upon by rain, were mechanically,
	or in solution, carried off by the water to
	the lowest levels, the elevations being
	<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199"> </a>thereby depressed, and the valleys proportionally
	raised. The low lands became
	of course the channels through which the
	rains returned to the sea, and the successive
	deposits on their sides, hardened
	by the wind and sun, have in five or six
	thousand years created such tracts of alluvial
	soil, as those which now present
	themselves in contiguity with most rivers.
	The soil, thus assembled and compounded,
	is similar in its nature to the rocks and
	hills whence it was washed; but, having
	been so pulverized and so divided by solution,
	it forms the finest medium for the
	secretion of all vegetable principles, and
	hence the banks of rivers are the favourite
	residences of man. Should the channel
	constantly narrow itself more and more,
	till it becomes choaked in its course, or
	at its outlet, then, for a time, lakes would
	be formed, which in like manner would
	narrow themselves and disappear. New
	channels would then be formed, or the
	rain would so diffuse itself over the surface,
	that the fall and the evaporation
	would balance each other.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"> </a>Such are the unceasing works of <strong class="special_emphasis">CREATION</strong>,
	constantly taking place on this exterior
	surface of the earth; where, though
	less evident to the senses and experience
	of man, matter apparently inert is in as
	progressive a state of change from the
	operation of unceasing and immutable
	causes, as in the visible generations of
	the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Thus
	water, wind, and heat, the energies of
	which <strong class="special_emphasis">NEVER CEASE</strong> to be exerted, are
	constantly producing new combinations,
	changes, and creations; which, if they
	accord with the harmony of the whole,
	are fit and “good;” but, if discordant,
	are speedily re-organized or extinguished
	by contrary and opposing powers. In a
	word, <strong class="special_emphasis">WHATEVER IS, IS FIT; AND

	<p>A lane, in the north-west corner of the
	Common, brought me to Barnes’ Elms,
	where now resides a Mr. Hoare, a banker
	of London. The family were not at
	home; but, on asking the servants if that
	was the house of Mr. Tonson, they assured
	me, with great simplicity, that no such
	gentleman lived there. I named the Kit-Cat
	Club, as accustomed to assemble
	here; but the oddity of the name excited
	their ridicule; and I was told that no such
	Club was held there; but, perhaps, said
	one to the other, the gentleman means
	the Club that assembles at the public-house
	on the Common. Knowing, however,
	that I was at the right place, I
	could not avoid expressing my vexation,
	that the periodical assemblage of the first
	men of their age, should be so entirely
	forgotten by those who now reside on the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202"> </a>spot—when one of them exclaimed, “I
	should not wonder if the gentleman means
	the philosopher’s room.”—“Aye,” rejoined
	his comrade, “I remember somebody
	coming once before to see something
	of this sort, and my master sent him
	there.” I requested then to be shewn to
	this room; when I was conducted across
	a detached garden, and brought to a
	handsome structure in the architectural
	style of the early part of the last century—evidently
	the establishment of the Kit-Cat
	Club!</p>

	<p>A walk covered with docks, thistles,
	nettles, and high grass, led from the remains
	of a gate-way in the garden-wall,
	to the door which opened into the building.
	Ah! thought I, along this desolate
	avenue the finest geniuses in England gaily
	proceeded to meet their friends;—yet within
	a century, how changed—how deserted—how
	revolting! A cold chill seized me, as
	the man unfastened the decayed door of
	the building, and as I beheld the once-elegant
	hall, filled with cobwebs, a fallen
	<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"> </a>ceiling, and accumulating rubbish. On the
	right, the present proprietor had erected
	a copper, and converted one of the parlours
	into a wash-house! The door on
	the left led to a spacious and once superb
	staircase, now in ruins, filled with
	dense cobwebs, which hung from the lofty
	ceiling, and seemed to be deserted even
	by the spiders! The entire building,
	for want of ventilation, having become
	food for the fungus, called dry-rot, the
	timber had lost its cohesive powers. I
	ascended the staircase, therefore, with a
	feeling of danger, to which the man would
	not expose himself;—but I was well requited
	for my pains. Here I found the
	Kit-Cat Club-room, nearly as it existed
	in the days of its glory. It is eighteen
	feet high, and forty feet long, by twenty
	wide. The mouldings and ornaments
	were in the most superb fashion of its age;
	but the whole was falling to pieces, from
	the effects of the dry-rot.</p>

	<p>My attention was chiefly attracted by
	the faded cloth-hanging of the room,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"> </a>whose red colour once set off the famous
	portraits of the Club, that hung
	around it. Their marks and sizes were
	still visible, and the numbers and names
	remained as written in chalk for the
	guidance of the hanger! Thus was I, as it
	were, by these still legible names, brought
	into personal contact with Addison, and
	Steele, and Congreve, and Garth, and
	Dryden, and with many <em>hereditary</em> nobles,
	remembered, only because they were patrons
	of those <em>natural</em> nobles!—I read
	their names aloud!—I invoked their departed
	spirits!—I was appalled by the
	echo of my own voice!—The holes in the
	floor, the forests of cobwebs in the windows,
	and a swallow’s nest in the corner of
	the ceiling, proclaimed that I was viewing
	a vision of the dreamers of a past age,—that
	I saw realized before me the speaking
	vanities of the anxious career of
	man! The blood of the reader of sensibility
	will thrill as mine thrilled! It was
	feeling without volition, and therefore incapable
	of analysis!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205"> </a>I could not help lingering in a place so
	consecrated by the religion of Nature;
	and, sitting down for a few minutes on
	some broken boards, I involuntarily shed
	a tear of sympathy for the departed great—for
	times gone by,—here brought before
	my eyes in so tangible a shape! I
	yielded to the unsophisticated sentiments
	which I could not avoid reading in this
	<strong class="special_emphasis">VOLUME</strong> of ruins; and felt, by irresistible
	association, that every object of our affections—that
	our affections themselves—and
	that all things that delight us, must
	soon pass away like this place and its
	former inhabitants! <em class="special_name">Beginning yesterday—flourishing
	to-day—ceasing to-morrow!</em>—such is the
	sum of the history of all organized being!
	Certain combinations excite, and the creative
	powers proceed with success, till
	balanced by the inertia of the materials—a
	contest of maturity arises, measured in
	length by the activity of the antagonist
	powers;—but the <em>unceasing</em> inertia finally
	prevails over the original excitement and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"> </a>its accessary stimuli, and ultimately produces
	disorganization and dissolution! Such
	is the abstract view of the physical laws
	which, in the peculiar career of intellectual
	man, successively give rise to <strong class="special_emphasis">HOPE</strong>
	in youth—<strong class="special_emphasis">PRIDE</strong> in manhood—<strong class="special_emphasis">REFLECTION</strong>
	in decay—and <strong class="special_emphasis">HUMILITY</strong> in old
	age. He knows his fate to be inevitable—but
	every day’s care is an epitome of
	his course, and every night’s sleep affords
	an anticipation of its end!—He is thus
	taught to die—and, if in spite of his
	vices or follies he should live till his
	world has passed away before him, he
	will then contentedly await the termination
	of that vital action which, creating
	no passion, affords no enjoyment. Such,
	said I, is the scheme of <em class="special_name">Benevolence</em>,
	which, by depriving the prospect of death
	of its terrors, makes room, without suffering,
	for a succession of new generations,
	to whose perceptions the world is
	ever young. The only wise use therefore
	which men can make of scenes like that
	before me, is to deduce from them a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"> </a>lesson of moderation and humility;—for,
	such as are these dumb, though visible
	cares of that generation—such will our
	own soon be!</p>

	<p>On rejoining Mr. Hoare’s man in the
	hall below, and expressing my grief that
	so interesting a building should be suffered
	to go to decay for want of attention, he
	told me that his master intended to pull
	it down and unite it to an adjoining barn,
	so as to form of the two a riding-house;
	and I learn that this design has since
	been executed! The Kit-Cat pictures
	were painted early in the eighteenth
	century, and, about the year 1710, were
	brought to this spot; but the room I have
	been describing was not built till ten or
	fifteen years afterwards. They were forty-two
	in number, and were presented by
	the members to the elder Tonson, who
	died in 1736. He left them to his great
	nephew, also an eminent bookseller, who
	died in 1767. They were then removed
	from this building to the house of his
	brother, at Water-Oakley, near Windsor;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"> </a>and, on his death, to the house of Mr.
	Baker, of Hertingfordbury, where they
	now remain, and where I lately saw
	them splendidly lodged and in fine preservation.
	It may be proper to observe,
	that the house of Mr. Hoare was
	not the house of Mr. Tonson, and that
	Mr. Tonson’s house stood nearer to the
	Kit-Cat Club-rooms, having a few years
	since been taken down. The situation
	is certainly not a happy one, being on a
	level with the Thames, and the adjacent
	grounds being deeply flooded at high
	tides. It is, however, completely sequestered
	from vulgar approach, and on
	that account was, perhaps, preferred as
	the retreat of a man of business.</p>

	<p>At <em class="special_name">Barnes’ Elms</em> lived the virtuous
	minister of Elizabeth, Sir <em class="special_name">Francis Walsingham</em>,
	and here he once entertained
	that chivalrous queen. <em class="special_name">Cowley</em>, the
	poet, afterwards resided here; and, in a
	later age <em class="special_name">Heydegger</em>, the buffoon,
	who gave an eccentric entertainment to
	the second Guelph, and contrived to gratify
	<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"> </a>his listless mind by an ingenious surprize,
	in at first making him believe that he
	was not prepared to receive him, and then
	contriving a sudden burst of lights, music,
	and gaiety.</p>

	<p>In returning through the lane which led
	from the Kit-Cat Club-room to Barnes
	Common, the keenest emotions of the
	human mind were excited by an unforeseen
	cause. I was admiring the luxuriance
	and grandeur of the vegetation, in
	trees which from the very ground expanded
	in immense double trunks, and in
	the profusion of weeds and shrubs which
	covered every part of the untrodden surface—when,
	on a sudden, I caught the distant
	sound of a ring of <strong class="special_emphasis">VILLAGE BELLS</strong>.
	Nothing could be more in accordance
	with the predispositions of my mind. All
	the melancholy which is created by the
	recurrence of the same succession of tones,
	instantly controlled and oppressed my feelings.
	I became the mere patient of these
	sounds; and I sank, as it were, under the
	force of gloomy impressions, which so
	<a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210"> </a>completely lulled and seduced me, that I
	suffered without being able to exert an
	effort to escape from their magic spell.
	Seldom had the power of sound acquired
	a similar ascendency over me. I
	seemed to be carried back by it to days
	and events long passed away. My soul,
	so to speak, was absorbed; and I leaned
	upon a gate, partly to indulge the reverie,
	partly as an effect of lassitude, and
	partly to listen more attentively to the
	sounds which caused so peculiar a train of
	feeling.</p>

	<p>There were six bells; and they rang
	what might be designed for a merry peal, to
	celebrate some village festival; or, perhaps,
	thought I, they may be profaning a sanctuary
	of the religion of peace, and outraging
	a land of freedom, to announce
	some bloody victory, gained by legions
	of trained slaves, over patriots who have
	been asserting the liberties and defending
	the independence of their country.
	Whichever might be the purpose, (for,
	alas! the latter, among my degenerated
	<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"> </a>countrymen, is as likely as the former,)
	the recurring tones produced corresponding
	vibrations on my nerves, and I felt
	myself played upon like a concordant musical
	instrument. Presently, however, it
	occurred to me, that I was not an entire
	stranger to the tones of those bells, and
	that part of their fascination arose from
	an association between them and some
	of the earliest and dearest objects in my
	remembrance. “Surely,” I exclaimed,
	“they are <em class="special_name">Chiswick bells</em>!—the very
	bells under the sound of which I received
	part of my early education, and,
	as a school-boy, passed the happiest days
	of my life!—Well may their tones vibrate
	to my inmost soul—and kindle uncommon
	sympathies!” I now recollected
	that the winding of the river must have
	brought me nearer to that simple and
	primitive village than the profusion of
	wood had permitted me to perceive, and
	my nerves had been unconsciously acted
	upon by tones which served as keys
	to all the associations connected with
	<a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"> </a>these bells, their church, and the village
	of Chiswick! I listened again, and now
	discriminated the identical sounds which
	I had not heard during a period of more
	than thirty years. I distinguished the
	very words, in the successive tones, which
	the school-boys and puerile imaginations
	at Chiswick used to combine with them.
	In fancy, I became again a school-boy—“Yes,”
	said I, “the six bells
	repeat the village-legend, and tell me
	that “<em>my dun cow has just calv’d</em>,” exactly
	as they did above thirty years
	since!”—Did the reader ever encounter
	a similar key-note, leading to a multitude
	of early and vivid impressions; for
	in like manner these sympathetic tones
	brought before my imagination numberless
	incidents and personages, no longer
	important, or no longer in existence. My
	scattered and once-loved school-mates,
	their characters, and their various fortunes,
	passed in rapid review before me;—my
	school-master, his wife, and all the gentry,
	and heads of families, whose orderly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"> </a>attendance at Divine service on Sundays,
	while those well-remembered bells were
	“chiming for church,” (but now departed
	and mouldering in the adjoining graves!)
	were rapidly presented to my recollection.
	With what pomp and form they used to
	enter and depart from their house of
	God!—I saw with the mind’s eye the
	widow Hogarth and her maiden relative,
	Richardson, walking up the aisle, dressed
	in their silken sacks, their raised headdresses,
	their black calashes, their lace
	ruffles, and their high crook’d canes, preceded
	by their aged servant, Samuel;
	who, after he had wheeled his mistress
	to church in her Bath-chair, carried the
	prayer-books up the aisle, and opened
	and shut the pew! There too was the
	portly Dr. Griffiths, of the Monthly Review,
	with his literary wife in her neat
	and elevated wire-winged cap! And oft-times
	the vivacious and angelic Duchess
	of Devonshire, whose bloom had not then
	suffered from the canker-worm of pecuniary
	distress, created by the luxury of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"> </a>charity! Nor could I forget the humble
	distinction of the aged sexton Mortefee,
	whose skill in psalmody enabled him to
	lead that wretched groupe of singers,
	whom Hogarth so happily pourtrayed;
	whose performance with the tuning-fork
	excited so much wonder in little boys;
	and whose gesticulations and contortions of
	head, hand, and body, in beating time,
	were not outdone, even by Joah Bates
	in the commemorations of Handel! Yes,
	simple and happy villagers! I remember
	scores of you;—how fortunately ye had
	escaped the contagion of the metropolitan
	vices, though distant but five miles; and
	how many of you have I conversed with,
	who, at an adult age, had never beheld
	the degrading assemblage of its knaveries
	and miseries!</p>

	<p>I revelled in the melancholy pleasure
	of these recollections, yielding my whole
	soul to that witchery of sensibility, which
	magnifies the perception of being, till one
	of the bells was overset; when, the peal
	stopping, I had leisure to reflect on the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215"> </a>rapid advance of the day, and on the
	consequent necessity of quickening my
	speed.</p>

	<p>At the end of this lane I crossed a
	road, which I found led to Chiswick
	Ferry. The opening gave increased effect
	to the renewed peal, and I regretted
	that I could not then indulge in a nearer
	approach to that beloved spot. I passed
	a farm-house and some neat villas, and
	presently came to the unostentatious, but
	interestingly-ancient structure of Barnes
	Church, situated on the Common, at the
	distance of a quarter of a mile from the
	village. I essayed to enter the church-yard
	to read some of the chronicles of
	mortality, particularly as it invited attention
	by the unusual object of a display
	of elegant <em>Roses</em>, which I afterwards
	learnt had been cultivated on the same spot
	about 150 years, to indulge the conceit
	of a person of the name of <em>Rose</em>, who
	was buried there, and left an acre of
	ground to the parish to defray the expence;
	but I found the gate locked, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page216" title="216"> </a>was told it was never opened, except
	during service. I confess I was not
	pleased with this regulation, because it
	appeared to sever the affections of the
	living from their proper sympathy with
	the dead. I have felt in the same manner
	in regard to the inclosed cemeteries of the
	metropolis: they separate the dead too
	abruptly from surviving friends and relatives.
	Grief seeks to indulge itself unobserved;
	it desires to be unrestrained by
	forms and hours, and to vent itself in
	perfect solitude. The afflicted wife longs
	to weep over the grave of her husband;
	the husband to visit the grave of a beloved
	wife; and the tender mother seeks
	the spot endeared by the remains of her
	child: but they cannot submit to the formality
	of asking permission, or allow their
	griefs to be intruded upon by strange attendants.
	Such tributes to our unsophisticated
	feelings are, however, denied
	by the locks, bolts, and walls, of the
	metropolitan cemeteries. The practised
	grave-digger wonders at the indulgence of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page217" title="217"> </a>unavailing woe—the unconscious tenants
	of his domain possess no peculiar claims
	on his sympathy—he cannot conceive how
	any can be felt by others—and, if he
	grant permission to enter, it must be for
	some cause more urgent, and more apparent,
	than that of bewailing over a
	grave! Did it never occur, however, to
	the clergymen who superintend these depositories
	of mortality, that more respect
	is due to the feelings of survivors? Is it
	necessary for any evident purpose, that
	the gates should be locked at any time,
	or for more than a few hours in the
	night? And, if even this privation be
	suffered merely from the fear of resurrection-men,
	is it not due to the best
	feelings of our nature that the severest
	punishment should attach to the crime of
	stealing dead bodies? What can now be
	learnt of anatomy which cannot be found
	in books and models, or be taught in the
	dissection of murderers? I would therefore
	rather bury a detected resurrection-man
	alive with the body he might
	<a class="pagenum" id="page218" title="218"> </a>be stealing, than shut out the living
	from all communion with the dead, and
	from all the sympathies and lessons addressed
	to the heart and understanding by
	their unrestricted intercourse.</p>

	<p><em class="special_name">Barnes</em> consists of a few straggling
	houses opposite the Common, of a mean
	street leading to the water-side, and of a
	row of elegant houses facing the Thames,
	on a broad terrace nearly half a mile
	long. On the opposite side of the river
	is a tract of new-made swampy ground,
	shaped circularly by the winding of the
	river. The chord of this circle extends
	from Chiswick to Strand-on-the-Green;
	and upon it is seen the exquisitely beautiful
	villa of the Duke of Devonshire,
	where Charles James Fox lately terminated
	his patriotic career; and on the left
	are the house and extensive grounds
	long occupied by the amiable Valentine
	Morris, esq. who, on his death-bed in
	Italy, in 1786, bequeathed these premises
	and a competent annuity as a provision
	for about thirty aged horses and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page219" title="219"> </a>dogs,—and here some of them survived till
	within these seven years, dying, from the
	gradual decay of their vital powers, at the
	ages of forty and fifty.</p>

	<p>The beauty and seclusion of this terrace
	have long invited the residence of
	persons of wealth and distinction. Many
	of those Frenchmen who, from interested
	connexions, or the prejudices of education,
	preferred exile and comparative
	poverty in foreign lands, to the reign
	of liberty and reason at home, came to
	reside on this spot. Here was acted the
	terrible tragedy of the <em class="special_name">Count</em> and
	<em class="special_name">Countess D’Antraigues</em>. These famous
	intriguants, after traversing Europe
	to enlist the vain prejudices of kings, and
	the sycophant spirit of courtiers, against
	the unalterable principles of the rights of
	man, settled themselves in a small house
	near the upper end of this terrace. Here
	their establishment consisted only of a
	single Italian footman, and two maid-servants.
	One day in every week they
	went to London, in a hired coach, to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"> </a>confer with their partizans; and it was on
	the morning of one of these excursions
	that these unhappy persons were suddenly
	butchered by their Italian footman. The
	coach stood at the door, and the Count
	and Countess had descended the stairs,
	when the servant, rushing from the parlour,
	fired a pistol at the Count; the ball
	of which struck, but did not injure him.
	It, however, so much surprised him as to
	throw him off his guard, when the wretch
	struck him with a stiletto between the
	shoulders. The Count at first reeled on
	the step of the door, but instantly rushed
	up stairs, as is supposed, to get arms
	from his bed-chamber, which he reached,
	but only to fall dead on the floor. In
	the mean time, the Countess, who was
	two or three paces in advance, and had
	reached the carriage-door, not aware of
	the cause of the report of the pistol,
	and of the Count’s precipitate retreat,
	asked the man, peevishly, why he did
	not open the door? He advanced as if
	to do it; but instantly stabbed her in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"> </a>the breast to the hilt of his weapon: she
	shrieked, reeled a few yards, and fell dead
	beside the post which adjoins the house to
	the West, on the pavement near which
	her blood was lately visible. The villain
	himself fled up-stairs to the room where
	his master lay weltering in his blood, and
	then, with a razor, cut his own throat.
	I saw the coachman, who told me that
	scarcely five minutes elapsed between the
	time when he heard them approach the carriage
	and beheld them corpses! The several
	acts were begun and over in an instant.
	At first he could not conceive what was
	passing; and, though he leaped from the
	box to the aid of the dying lady, he had
	then no suspicion of the fate of the Count.
	I took pains to ascertain the assassin’s motive
	for committing such horrid deeds; but
	none can be traced beyond a feeling of
	revenge, excited by a supposed intention
	of his master to discard him, and send
	him out of the kingdom; a design which,
	it is said, he discovered by listening on
	the stairs to the conversation of the Count
	<a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222"> </a>and Countess, while they were enjoying
	the water-scene by moon-light, on the
	preceding evening, from their projecting
	windows. It was impossible to view the
	spot where such a tragedy had been acted,
	without horror, and without deep sympathy
	for the victims; yet it gratified me to find
	the house already inhabited by a respectable
	family, because it thus appeared that
	there are now dispersed through society
	many whose minds are raised above the
	artifices of superstition,—which, in no distant
	age, would have filled these premises
	with ghosts and hobgoblins, till they had
	become a bye-word and a heap of ruins!</p>

	<p>Nearly adjoining and behind the residence
	of Count d’Antraigues, stand the
	premises and grounds long occupied by
	another distinguished emigrant, the Marquis
	de Chabanes, a relation of the notorious
	and versatile Talleyrand. This marquis
	here pursued two speculations, by
	which, at the time, he attracted attention
	and applause. In the first he undertook
	to give useful body and consistency to the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"> </a>dust of coals, of which thousands of tons,
	before their application to gas-lights, were
	annually wasted in the shipping and coal-wharfs;
	and for this purpose he erected
	a manufactory; but, after much loss of
	labour and property, found it necessary
	to abandon the project. In the second
	speculation, he proposed to introduce various
	French improvements into English
	horticulture, and undertook to supply the
	fruiterers of the metropolis with tender
	and unseasonable fruits and vegetables, in
	greater perfection, and at a lower rate,
	than they had heretofore been supplied
	by the English gardeners. For this purpose
	he built large and high walls, and
	very extensive hot-houses and conservatories;
	but, being unable to contend
	against the fickleness of our climate, he
	found it necessary to abandon this scheme
	also; when the glasses, the frames, &amp;c.
	were sold by auction; and no vestiges
	now remain of his labours, but his vines
	and the ruins of his flues and foundation-walls.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"> </a>During my inquiries of the working
	gardener who has succeeded him on the
	ground, I learnt some particulars in regard
	to the economy by which the metropolis
	receives its vast supplies of fruits
	and fresh vegetables. Mr. <em class="special_name">Middleton</em>,
	in his philosophical Survey of Middlesex,
	estimates the quantity of garden-ground,
	within ten miles of the metropolis,
	at 15,000 acres, giving employment in the
	fruit-season to 60,000 labourers. The
	mode of conveying this vast produce to
	market creates habits among this numerous
	class of people which are little
	suspected by the rest of the community.
	A gardener’s life appears to be one of
	the most primitive and natural; but,
	passed near London, it is as artificial and
	unnatural as any known to our forced
	state of society. Covent-garden market
	is held three days in the week, and other
	markets on the same or other days; and,
	as vegetables ought to be eaten as soon as
	possible after they are gathered, it is the
	business of the gardener to gather one
	<a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"> </a>day and sell the next; hence the intervening
	night is the period of conveyance
	from the places of growth to those of
	consumption. All the roads round London,
	therefore, are covered with market-carts,
	and waggons during the night, so
	that they may reach the markets by three,
	four, or five o’clock, when the dealers
	attend; and these markets are over by
	six or seven. The shops of retailers are
	then supplied by the aid of ill-paid Irish
	women, who carry loads of a hundredweight
	to all parts of London on their
	heads, to meet the demands of good
	house-wives, who, at ten or eleven, buy
	their garden-stuff for the day. This rapid
	routine creates a prodigious quantity of
	labour for men, women, and horses. Every
	gardener has his market-cart or carts,
	which he loads at sun-set; and, they
	depart at ten, eleven, twelve, or one
	o’clock, according to the distance from
	London. Each cart is accompanied by a
	driver, and also by a person to sell, generally
	the gardener’s wife; who, having
	<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"> </a>sold the load, returns with the team by
	nine or ten o’clock in the morning; and
	has thus finished the business of the day,
	before half the inhabitants of London
	have risen from their beds. Such is
	the economy of every gardener’s family
	within ten miles of London,—of some
	every night, and of others every other
	night, during at least six months in the
	year. The high vegetable season in summer,
	as well as peculiar crops at other
	times, call for exertions of labour, or rather
	of slavery, scarcely paralleled by any other
	class of people. Thus, in the strawberry
	season, hundreds of women are employed
	to carry that delicate fruit to market on
	their heads; and their industry in performing
	this task is as wonderful, as their
	remuneration is unworthy of the opulent
	classes who derive enjoyment from their
	labour. They consist, for the most part,
	of Shropshire and Welsh girls, who walk
	to London at this season in droves, to
	perform this drudgery, just as the Irish
	peasantry come to assist in the hay and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"> </a>corn harvests. I learnt that these women
	carry upon their heads baskets of strawberries,
	or raspberries, weighing from forty
	to fifty pounds, and make two turns in
	the day, from Isleworth to market, a distance
	of thirteen miles each way; three
	turns from Brentford, a distance of nine
	miles; and four turns from Hammersmith;
	a distance of six miles. For the most
	part, they find some conveyance back;
	but even then these industrious creatures
	carry loads from twenty-four to thirty
	miles a-day, besides walking back unladen
	some part of each turn! Their remuneration
	for this unparalleled slavery is from
	8<i>s.</i> to 9<i>s.</i> per day; each turn from the
	distance of Isleworth being 4<i>s.</i> or 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>;
	and from that of Hammersmith 2<i>s.</i> or
	2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> Their diet is coarse and simple,
	their drink, tea and small-beer; costing
	not above 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and their back-conveyance
	about 2<i>s.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; so that
	their net gains are about 5<i>s.</i> per day,
	which, in the strawberry season, of forty
	days, amounts to 10<i>l.</i> After this period
	<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"> </a>the same women find employment in
	gathering and marketing vegetables, at
	lower wages, for other sixty days, netting
	about 5<i>l.</i> more. With this poor pittance
	they return to their native county, and
	it adds either to their humble comforts, or
	creates a small dowry towards a rustic
	establishment for life. Can a more interesting
	picture be drawn of virtuous
	exertion? Why have our poets failed to
	colour and finish it? More virtue never
	existed in their favourite Shepherdesses
	than in these Welsh and Shropshire girls!
	For beauty, symmetry, and complexion,
	they are not inferior to the nymphs of
	Arcadia, and they far outvie the pallid
	specimens of Circassia! Their morals too
	are exemplary; and they often perform
	this labour to support aged parents, or to
	keep their own children from the workhouse!
	In keen suffering, they endure
	all that the imagination of a poet could
	desire; they live hard, they sleep on
	straw in hovels and barns, and they often
	burst an artery, or drop down dead from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"> </a>the effect of heat and over-exertion! Yet,
	such is the state of one portion of our
	female population, at a time when we are
	calling ourselves the most polished nation
	on earth, and pretending to be so wealthy
	that we give away millions a-year to foreigners
	unsolicited, and for no intelligible
	purpose! And such too is their dire necessity,
	that it would be most cruel to
	suggest or recommend any invention that
	might serve as a substitute for their slavery,
	and thereby deprive them of its
	wretched annual produce!</p>

	<p>The transit from Barnes to Mortlake
	is but a few paces; a small elbow in the
	road forming their point of separation.
	Both of them contain some handsome
	villas, and they are pleasantly situated on
	the banks of the Thames; yet they are
	less beautiful than they might be rendered,
	by very slender attentions. There is no
	public taste, no love of natal soil, no
	pride of emulation apparent, though the
	scite is one of the finest in England.
	A few mansions of the opulent adorn
	<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"> </a>both villages, and the country fascinates
	in spite of the inhabitants; but the third
	and fourth rate houses have a slovenly,
	and often a kind of pig-sty character, disgusting
	to those who, in the beautiful
	towns and villages of Essex, have seen
	what may be done, to improve the habitations
	even of humble life. Lovely
	Witham, and Kelvedon, and Coggeshall!
	what examples you set to all other
	towns in your neatly painted and whitened
	houses—unostentatious, though cheerful—and
	inviting, though chaste and modest!
	What a contrast do you present to the
	towns and villages in Middlesex and
	Surrey, and even in Kent! If poverty
	forbids a stuccoed or plastered wall, the
	cleanly and oft-repeated whitewash proves
	the generous public spirit of the occupant,
	while the outside seldom has occasion to
	blush for the inside. A spirit of harmony
	runs through the whole, and a pure habitation
	is indicative of pure inhabitants;
	thus, cleanliness in the house leads to neatness
	of apparel—both require order, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"> </a>out of order grow moral habits, domestic
	happiness, and the social virtues. Nor
	is this theory fanciful; Witham, Kelvedon,
	and Coggeshall, form a district
	which is at once the most beautiful, the
	least vicious, and the happiest, in the
	kingdom. One virtue is doubtless consequent
	on another, and one good habit
	generates another; the result is the
	harmonious triumph of virtue! If it be
	doubted whether the white-washed exterior
	is more than “an outward and visible
	sign” of the purity within, I reply—that
	virtue is so much the effect of habit, that
	whatever improves the habits improves
	the character; and that, if a house were
	frequently white-washed within and without,
	it could scarcely fail to banish personal
	filth from the inmates; while habits
	of cleanliness, which call for habits of industry,
	would produce the rest. I have,
	indeed, often thought that it would be an
	efficacious means of bettering the morals,
	as well as the health, of the London poor,
	if St. Giles’s, Hockly-in-the-hole, Fleet-lane,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"> </a>Saffron-hill, and other dens of vice
	and misery, were by law lime-washed
	inside and outside twice in every year.
	But, in whatever degree this doctrine may
	be just, let me hope these observations
	will meet the eye of some active philanthropists,
	who, being thus taught to consider
	cleanliness as an auxiliary of morals
	and happiness, will be induced so to paint
	and whiten our dusky-coloured villages
	and dirty towns, as to render them worthy
	of virtuous residents, in the hope that,
	by reciprocation, they may render themselves
	worthy of their purified habitations.</p>

	<p>I do not charge on Barnes and Mortlake
	exclusively the characteristics of filth—they
	are not inferior to other villages within
	ten miles; but the whole require improvement,
	and I recommend Witham, Kelvedon,
	and other places in that district of
	Essex, to their imitation.</p>

	<p>Mortlake church-yard and its ancient
	church stand pleasantly on the north side
	of a large field, across which is a picturesque
	foot-path to East Sheen. I inquired
	<a class="pagenum" id="page233" title="233"> </a>eagerly for the tomb of Partridge,
	the almanack-maker and astrologer, and
	found it in the south-east corner, in a tottering
	condition. Relics so famous would,
	it might have been supposed, have extorted
	from the Parish Vestry a single hod
	of mortar, and an hour’s labour of a
	mason, to sustain it: yet thus it is, not
	only at Mortlake, but every where. Nothing
	is conceded to public feeling, and
	the most venerable monuments are suffered
	to fall to decay for want of the
	most trifling repairs. The following inscription
	is still legible on the slab of the
	tomb:—</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><em class="special_name">Johannes Partridge</em>, Astrologus et Medicinæ
		Doctor, natus est apud East-Sheen, in comitatu
		Surrey, 8º die Januarii, anno 1644, et mortuus est
		Londini 24º die Junii, anno 1715. Medicinam fecit

	</blockquote>

	<p>How many are the associations which
	grow out of this name of <em class="special_name">Partridge</em>!
	He was one of the last of the learned
	votaries of Astrology, the mother of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"> </a>sciences, though herself the daughter of
	superstition. His works on genitures, and
	on the errors of his favourite science, are
	specimens of acute reasoning, not exceeded
	by the ablest disquisitions on more
	worthy subjects. Yet he was held up by
	Swift as an impostor, though Swift himself
	lived by a show of faith in other mysteries,
	for which his reverence is very
	doubtful. Not so Partridge; he evidently
	believed sincerely that the stars were
	indices of fate, and he wrote and acted
	in that belief, however much he may have
	been deceived by appearances. He found,
	as all students in astrology find, that
	every horoscope enabled him to foretel
	with precision a certain number of events;
	and, if his prognostics failed in some
	cases, he ascribed the failure to no defect
	of his celestial intelligencers, but to the
	errors or short-sightedness of his art.
	Good, and even wise men have, in all
	ages, been deceived by the same appearances.
	They found that the planets foretold
	some events; they thence inferred
	<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"> </a>that the planets ruled those and all events;
	and, if the science often disappointed
	them, they found an apology for it in
	their own mistaken judgments, or in the
	errors introduced into it by different
	authors. Astrologers were therefore not
	impostors, as they are often described by
	the over-righteous, the hasty, or the ignorant.
	They found a science reared on
	the observations and experience of the
	remotest antiquity, and their prognostications
	were deduced from its established
	laws. Its practices were directed by the
	unerring motions of the earth, moon, and
	planets; and it possessed characteristics
	of grandeur and sublimity, arising from
	the magnitude and solemnity of its sources,
	and from the eternal laws which regulated
	them.</p>

	<p>The errors on which this science was
	reared, were not, however, peculiar to
	astrologers. They were engendered by
	ignorance, and nurtured by superstition
	and priestcraft. Every event happens in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"> </a>its own way, and cannot happen in
	any other way than that in which it has
	actually happened; or, in other words, an
	event cannot happen and not happen, or
	a thing cannot be and not be. This necessary
	determination of every event in a
	single manner, the consequence of commensurate
	proximate causes, which it is
	often difficult to analyse, served as a
	fruitful source of superstitious feeling, and
	as a handle for the priests among the
	early nations of antiquity. In whatever
	way an event happened, that was said to
	be its Fate, notwithstanding a slight exercise
	of reason would have shewn that
	what has happened in one way could not,
	at the same time, happen in another way.
	But, as it did happen in one way rather
	than another, the way in which it did
	happen was said to be predetermined;
	the kind of cause was not examined
	which determined it to happen as it did
	happen; the effect was even said to rule
	the causes; and all the causes, remote
	<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"> </a>and proximate, were said to be operative
	merely for the sake of producing the ultimate
	effect!</p>

	<p>As every event must happen in the way
	an which it has happened, a description
	of it, is but an expression of the <em>certainty</em>,
	that it has happened in such or such a
	particular manner. If this result be fortunate,
	then all the circumstances which led
	to it, however remote, are deemed to have
	been <em>lucky</em>; though, if it prove unfortunate,
	the same train of causes are then called
	<em>unlucky</em>. There was, however, neither luck
	nor ill-luck in these trains, because the
	remote or necessary physical causes did
	not determine the proximate and fluctuating
	mental ones. There existed no <em>necessary</em>
	connexion between these trains, besides
	the necessity or certainty that some
	result must be consequent on every train of
	events growing out of human life and action.
	These trains must, in all cases, produce
	some result, that is to say, a result of
	some kind, and not necessarily any particular
	result.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238"> </a>In considering the curious enigma in
	regard to <strong class="special_emphasis">FATALITY</strong>, men err in conceiving
	that all the remote causes which
	lead to an event, operate and combine for
	the sake of some particular result, instead
	of considering every personal or
	social event as the necessary single effect
	of the proximate causes; and they also
	confound the species of causes which produce
	events. There are two distinct sets
	of causes, the one physical and the other
	mental. The <em>physical</em> are determined by
	fixed, and often by known laws, and
	hence we are enabled to <em>foretel</em> the places
	of the planets and the moment when
	eclipses of the Sun and Moon will happen
	for a thousand years to come. The <em>mental</em>
	are governed by the varying experience,
	caprice, and self-love, generated
	within animal minds; and, being therefore
	measured by no fixed laws, produce results
	which cannot be anticipated, except
	in their proximate operation. These
	mental causes, so to speak, cross each
	other in every direction, and at one time
	<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239"> </a>may accelerate, though at another time
	they may retard, or give novel directions to
	physical causes; and, as they are generated
	in every successive moment by the errors
	and passions of fallible beings, and
	often have an extensive influence on the
	affairs of mankind, so they constitute an
	infinite variety of original causes, which, as
	no law creates them, no law leads to their
	effects; of course, therefore, their effects
	are not necessary, and no knowledge can
	exist, enabling men to anticipate that which
	is generated by no fixed laws, and which
	therefore is not necessary.</p>

	<p>I lately met a friend, who justly passes
	for a philosopher. He mentioned the
	distress of a family which he had just
	been relieving; “and, would you believe
	it,” said he—“if I had not passed along a
	street where I seldom go, and met a child
	of the family, I should have known
	nothing of their situation? Was it not
	evidently pre-ordained, therefore, that I
	should walk along that street, at that
	time, for the purpose of relieving that family?”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"> </a>“So, then,” said I, “you make the
	consequence determine the cause, rather
	than take the trouble to examine whether
	the causes were not equal to the effect,
	without being themselves necessary or irresistible.”
	“But then,” he replied, “there
	was such an aptness, such a coincidence,
	such a final purpose!”—“Ah!” I rejoined,
	“you cheat yourself by not extending your
	vocabulary—why not say there was sufficient
	affluence, guided by a benevolent heart—and
	such distress, that they were called
	into prompt exertion? Is it to be regarded
	as a miracle, that a benevolent
	heart proved the sufficient cause of a
	good action, and that distress was an excitement
	equivalent to the effect which
	you describe? The street was a medium
	or stage of action, as capable of leading
	to evil as to good. You could not be in
	two places at the same time; nor could
	the result be and not be. Had you been
	in another place, some other family might
	have been relieved from the collision of
	the same causes; and each event would,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"> </a>in like manner, have appeared to have
	determined the causes, instead of being a
	single consequence of the causes. Nor
	were these causes more necessary than the
	result. Your feelings were spontaneous,
	but you may in future change the result by
	hardening your heart, like other rich men.”
	“I will do neither,” said he, quickly.—“No,”
	said I, “I know you won’t—you
	will not violate your habitual inclinations.
	In future, however, do them justice; and,
	when you perform a kind action, do not
	make the consequence the cause.”<a href="#footnote_5" id="fnm5" title="As doctrines about fate..." class="fnmarker">5</a></p>

	<p>I sat on the tomb of Partridge, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242"> </a>thought it a fit place in which to ruminate
	on these involved points. Do the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243"> </a>astrologers (said I) consider the stars as
	mere indices of pretended fates, or as the
	causes of the events which they are enabled
	<a class="pagenum" id="page244" title="244"> </a>to anticipate by the anticipated motions
	of the stars? In nativities, they seem
	to consider them as <em>indices</em>; but, in
	horary questions, as <em>causes</em>. They are
	treated as indices in all cases wherein
	arbitrary numbers or measures, or imaginary
	points are introduced; but deemed
	material causes when particular events are
	<a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245"> </a>said to be coincident with actual positions.
	Both hypotheses cannot, however,
	be well founded; and his reason will call
	on the astrologer to give up the doctrine
	of indices of fate, and prefer that of
	secondary causes. Here then a still
	greater difficulty presents itself; the causes
	are general, and they must operate on
	the whole earth and all its inhabitants
	alike. A <span title="square">□</span> of <span title="Mars">♂</span> and <span title="Mercury">☿</span>, or a <span title="Triangle">△</span> of <span title="Saturn">♄</span> and
	<span title="Jupiter">♃</span>, (that is, a square aspect of Mars and
	Mercury, or a trine of Saturn and Jupiter,)
	whenever they happen, are alike applicable
	to all the inhabitants and regions of
	the earth. It was plausible to talk of a
	planetary aspect as productive of rain or
	wind, when the geography of the astrologer
	did not extend beyond the plains of
	Chaldea, or the immediate banks of the
	Nile; but our better knowledge of cosmography
	now teaches us, that, at the
	time of every aspect, every variety of
	season and of weather is prevalent in different
	parts of the world; and every contrariety
	of fortune is happening to individuals
	<a class="pagenum" id="page246" title="246"> </a>in all countries. The doctrine
	that the planets are secondary causes, is,
	therefore, not supported by the circumstances
	of the phenomena.</p>

	<p>But the astrologers are not content with
	natural positions, but, like the eastern
	priests with their gods, they assign different
	parts of the heavens, and different
	countries, to each planet; and then found
	prognostics on these local positions of the
	planets. It is evident, however, that the
	apparent position of a planet depends on
	the varying position of the earth, and
	that an inferior planet may be in exactly
	the same point of space, and yet be seen
	from the earth in every sign of the zodiac;
	though, according to the astrologers, it
	would in that same place have very different
	powers! This doctrine was admissible
	when the earth was considered
	as the centre of the universe; when the
	geocentric phenomena were considered as
	absolute; and when the apparently quick
	and slow motions, the retrogradations, and
	the stationary positions, were ascribed to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page247" title="247"> </a>caprices of the planets themselves, or to
	motives of their prime mover, and therefore
	were received as signs of corresponding
	events and fates!</p>

	<p>But the radical error of the art of prediction
	is more deeply seated than we are
	commonly aware of. There is a chance,
	however difficult it may be in all cases
	to reduce it to arithmetical precision, that
	any possible event may happen to a particular
	person. No possible event can
	indeed be conceived, that, with regard to
	a particular person, is not within the
	range of arithmetical probability; while
	all the probable events, such as predictors
	announce, are within very narrow
	limits. As an example, I assume, that,
	of any hundred ordinary events of human
	life, it may be an even chance that sixty of
	them will happen, or not happen; and, of
	the other forty, it may be as 20 to 1 that
	10 of them will happen; as 10 to 1 that
	other 10 will happen; as 1 to 10 that
	other 10 will happen; and as 1 to 20
	that the other 10 will happen. Then, by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page248" title="248"> </a>averaging all these chances, it will be
	found that it is an even chance that the
	whole will happen, or will not happen;
	or, in other words, that half will happen,
	and that half will not happen. If, therefore,
	a dextrous person foretel one hundred
	events, by means of <em>any</em> prognosticating
	key, or any index whose powers
	are previously settled,—whether stars,
	cards, sediments of tea, lines of the hand
	or forehead, entrails of animals, or dreams,
	signs or omens,—by the doctrine of chances
	it is an even, or some other fixed
	chance, that half, or some other portion,
	of such events will come to pass. Superstition
	will triumph if only 1 in 5, or
	1 in 10, happen as foretold; but, if 1 in
	2 or 3 should happen by neutralizing or
	generalizing the predictions, then the prophet
	is accounted a favourite of Heaven,
	or a familiar of Satan! For this purpose
	it signifies not what it is that constitutes
	the key of fate; it will sufficiently deceive
	the practitioner, if it relieve him from the
	responsibility of his announcements; and,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page249" title="249"> </a>if he prudently announce none but events
	highly probable, he will himself be astonished
	at the apparent verity of his art!
	In truth, he is all the while but the dupe
	of arithmetic; and a cool examination
	would shew him that, for the most part,
	it is an even chance that any predicted
	event will happen, which has been foretold
	by any key, or sign, or token. The
	planets, the signs of the zodiac, &amp;c. serve
	as one set of these keys, or indices—dreams
	serve as another—the entrails of
	animals have been used as another—signs,
	noises, omens, tokens, sympathies, &amp;c.
	are a fruitful source—lines of the hand,
	forehead, wrist, &amp;c. are others—moles,
	marks, &amp;c. furnish others—cards afford
	a rich variety—and the sediments of teacups,
	and I know not what besides, serve
	as means of announcing events by
	pre-arranged laws of association. The
	half, or more than half, of such events,
	must however necessarily happen by the
	averages of chances; and this unascertained
	and unsuspected coincidence has from age
	<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"> </a>to age countenanced and confirmed the
	delusion.</p>

	<p>All that a prophet or fortune-teller requires,
	therefore, is some set of <em>indices</em>, to
	each of which he can assign particular
	powers and significations, and then be
	able so to vary their order as to give them
	new and endless combinations, representing
	the fortunes of all mankind. When varied
	for a particular individual, he has
	merely to apply to that person the probable
	events indicated by the new combinations;
	and, according to the law of
	chances, he must necessarily succeed in a
	certain proportion of his prognostics, because
	it is within a certain numerical
	chance that any possible event will happen
	to any individual. The prognosticator
	in these cases is deceived, because he is
	solely directed by the order of his indices.
	As he finds that he has been enabled
	to <em>foretel</em> by their means a certain number
	of events, he conceives either that these
	indices must govern the fates; that the
	finger of Providence or the agency of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"> </a>Devil governed his indices; or, with many
	grave writers, that there is a soul of the
	world which harmonizes all things, producing
	an accordance between the <strong class="special_emphasis">FORTUNES</strong>
	of the <strong class="special_emphasis">HUMAN RACE</strong> and the
	sediments of tea-cups, the arrangements
	of cards, the aspects and positions of the
	planets, the lines in the hand or forehead,
	the indications of dreams, and the entrails
	of animals! On the other hand, the
	dupes of these prognostics, when fortunate,
	often direct their best exertions to fulfil
	them; or, when unfortunate, they sink into
	a feeling of despondency, which leads to
	their fulfilment. And, should one in ten of
	the predicted events take place, they become
	firm believers in the doctrines of
	fatality, necessity, and other superstitions;
	“for,” say they, “how could an event be
	foretold, if it had not been irrevocably decreed
	that it must happen?” What a powerful
	handle for priest-craft, state-craft, and
	all the crafts by which mankind have been
	abused in every age of the world!</p>

	<p>That this exposition of the true cause of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252"> </a>the popular errors, in regard to any supposed
	connexion between certain accidents
	of matter, and unconnected future
	events, will not be without its uses, must
	be evident from the known influence which
	some of the means of prognostication possess
	over every rank of society. Such
	scenes as that described in the Spectator,
	where so much unhappiness was created
	by spilling the salt, are still realized every
	day in nearly every family in Great Britain.
	All phenomena which cannot easily
	be accounted for, and hundreds of trivial
	incidents, are considered by the gravest
	as portentous signs of events to come.
	The coincidence of any event and its
	prognostic, though it might have been ten
	to one that it would happen, is received
	as evidence of their connexion, which it
	would be impiety to laugh at! But need
	I quote a more striking instance than the
	still prodigious annual sale of 300,000 of
	Partridge’s and Moore’s Almanacks, whose
	recommendations are their prognostications,
	and which a few years since lost
	<a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"> </a>most of their patrons, because the Stationers’
	Company, in the edition of the
	year, left out the predictions as an experiment
	on the public wisdom!</p>

	<p>In returning from the tomb of Partridge,
	I beheld another, dear to patriotism
	and civic glory, that of Alderman
	Barber, Lord-mayor of London in 1733.
	His memory is still cherished among aged
	citizens, and the cause is recorded in the
	following inscription:—</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“Under this stone were laid the remains of <em class="special_name">John
		Barber</em>, esq. alderman of London, a constant
		benefactor to the poor, true to his principles in
		church and state. He preserved his integrity, and
		discharged the duty of an upright magistrate. Zealous
		for the rights of his fellow citizens, he opposed
		all attempts against them; and, being lord mayor
		in the year 1733, he defeated a scheme of a general
		Excise, which, had it succeeded, would have put an
		end to the liberties of his country.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Virtuous citizen! Happy was it that
	thou didst not live to suffer the mortification
	of seeing thy degraded country
	devoured by swarms of excisemen, and
	the third of its population fattening on
	<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"> </a>the taxes collected from the other two-thirds.
	Too justly didst thou anticipate
	that the terrors and corruptions growing
	out of such an inquisition as the excise,
	would destroy that sturdy spirit of independence,
	which in thy day constituted
	the chief glory of the English country-gentleman
	and London merchant. Till
	it was broken or undermined by the evil
	genius of Taxation, that spirit served as
	the basis of Britain’s prosperity; but now,
	alas! it seems to be extinguished for
	ever.—Patriotic Lord-mayor of London!
	In thy day to watch with jealousy the
	never-ceasing encroachments of the regal
	prerogatives, and to render the ministers
	of the crown accountable at the bar of
	public opinion, were paths of honour
	leading to the highest civic distinctions!
	Many of the race that conducted to a
	wise end the glorious revolution of 1688
	then survived—the genius of liberty continued
	to inspire the sons of Britain—the
	holy flame that punished two kings for
	trespassing on the rights of their people,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255"> </a>was not entirely extinguished—the deadly
	paralysis of the Septennial Act had not
	then produced its blighting effects on the
	whole body politic. But London ceased
	to be influenced by the lost voice of
	<em class="special_name">Barber</em>, and the Excise system triumphed—the
	barriers of freedom were
	passed—trial by jury was, in certain cases,
	either dispensed with, or nullified by well-trained
	special juries—the public judgment
	was misled by venal conductors of
	the public press—patriotism was deemed
	faction—liberty was held up as another
	name for rebellion—and, in consequence,
	<strong class="special_emphasis">FORTY-FIVE YEARS OF FOREIGN WAR</strong>
	have disgraced <strong class="special_emphasis">SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS</strong>
	of our annals, though thirty years of
	foreign war served in the preceding three
	hundred years to vindicate every British
	interest!—Venerated name of <em class="special_name">Barber</em>!
	Where is the monument to be found in
	the public buildings of London, to record
	thy virtues for the example of others?
	Would it not be a worthy companion to
	the statues of Beckford and Chatham?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256"> </a>And would it not keep in countenance
	the honest exertions of the Waithmans—Woods—and
	Goodbeheres—who in our
	days have trod in thy steps, and who, it
	may be hoped, will have a long line of successors
	in the same honourable career?</p>

	<p>Being anxious to view the inside of
	Mortlake church, a boy undertook to
	fetch the key from the house of the sexton.
	In the mean time I examined around
	me the humble monuments raised by affection
	to the memory of the dead. Here
	were the pyramid, the obelisk, and the
	tumulus, in their most diminutive forms.
	Here lay decomposed the mineral parts of
	those ancestors from whom the contemporary
	generation have sprung. Yes,
	said I, we truly are all of one nature, and
	one family; and we suffer a common fate!
	We burst as germs into organization, we
	swell by a common progress into maturity,
	and we learn to measure by motion what
	we call Time, till, our motions and our time
	ceasing, we are thus laid side by side, generation
	after generation, serving as examples
	<a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257"> </a>of a similar futurity to those who
	spring from us, and succeed us.</p>

	<p>I reflected that, as it is now more than
	four hundred years since this ground became
	the depository of the dead, some
	of its earliest occupants might, without
	an hyperbole, have been ancestors of the
	whole cotemporary English nation. If we
	suppose that a man was buried in this
	church-yard 420 years ago, who left six
	children, each of whom had three children,
	who again had, on an average, the same
	number in every generation of thirty
	years; then, in 420 years, or fourteen
	generations, his descendants might be multiplied
	as under:</p>

	triangle, of which he would constitute
	the lower angle.</p>

	<p>To place the same position in another
	point of view, I calculated also that every
	individual now living must have had for
	his ancestor every parent in Britain living
	<a class="pagenum" id="page259" title="259"> </a>in the year 1125, the age of Henry the
	First, taking the population of that period
	at 8,000,000. Thus, as every individual
	must have had a father and a mother, or
	two progenitors, each of whom had a
	father and a mother, or four progenitors,
	each generation would double its progenitors
	every thirty years. Every person
	living may, therefore, be considered as the
	apex of a triangle, of which the base
	would represent the whole population of
	a remote age.</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">That is to say, if there have been a regular
	co-mixture of marriages, every individual
	of the living race must of necessity be
	descended from parents who lived in Britain
	in 1125. Some districts or clans may
	require a longer period for the co-mixture,
	and different circumstances may cut off
	some families, and expand others; but, in
	general, the lines of families would cross
	each other, and become interwoven <em>like
	the lines of lattice-work</em>. A single inter-mixture,
	however remote, would unite all
	the subsequent branches in common ancestry,
	rendering the cotemporaries of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page261" title="261"> </a>every nation members of one expanded
	family, after the lapse of an ascertainable
	number of generations!</p>

	<p>This principle is curious; and, though
	in one view it has been applied to calculations
	of increasing population, yet I am
	not aware that it has previously received
	the moral application which I draw from
	it, in regard to the commixture of the human
	race. My ideas may be better conceived,
	if any person draw two parallel
	lines to represent the respective contemporary
	populations of two distinct epochs;
	and then set up on the lower line an
	indefinite number of triangles. In this
	scheme we shall have a just picture of the
	progressive generations of every nation,
	and we may observe how necessarily, in
	spite of artifice and pride, they must, by
	intermarriages, be blended as one family
	and one flesh, owing to the individuals of
	each pair springing from a different apex,
	and to every side being necessarily crossed
	by the sides of other triangles. By a
	converse reasoning, or by tracing the lines
	<a class="pagenum" id="page262" title="262"> </a>from the apex to the base, we may trace
	the descent as well as the ascent; and,
	by a glance of the eye, ascertain not only
	that every individual of a living generation
	must be descended from the whole of
	the parents of some generation sufficiently
	remote, but that every parent in such remote
	generation must necessarily have
	been the ancestor of every individual of a
	contemporary generation.</p>

	<p>If, during the Crusades, any of the
	English intermarried with Greeks, or Syrians,
	or Italians, all of whom must, by
	intermingling, have been descendants of
	the great men of antiquity, so all the English
	of this age must be connected in
	blood with those intermarriages, and be
	descended from the heroes of the classic
	ages. But let not pride triumph in this
	consideration; for every malefactor in
	every age, who left children, was equally an
	ancestor of the living race! The ancient
	union of France and England, and of
	Belgium and Germany with England,
	must have rendered those people near of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263"> </a>kin; while each adjoining nation, mixing
	with its neighbours, must have blended
	the whole human race in one great family
	of remote common origin. This reasoning
	explains the cause of national physiognomy
	and character, the co-mixture
	of foreign nations being inconsiderable,
	and not sufficient to effect general characteristic
	changes; while each nation
	becomes, in the course of ages, one common
	and blended family, in physiognomy,
	character, and genius. May so plain a
	demonstration of this great truth be the
	means of promoting their concord, their
	love, the interchange of mutual good
	offices, and their common happiness!</p>

	<p>The messenger having brought the key,
	I was admitted into Mortlake church, the
	first glance of whose venerable structure,
	carried my imagination back through many
	distant ages, and generated a multitude of
	interesting associations. Every part of the
	building bore an air of antique simplicity;
	and it seemed truly worthy of being the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264"> </a>place where the inhabitants of a village
	ought to meet periodically to receive lessons
	of moral instruction, and pour forth
	their thanksgivings to the First Cause of
	the effects which daily operate on them as so
	many blessings. Happy system!—so well
	adapted to the actual condition of society,
	and so capable, when well directed, of producing
	the most salutary effects on the
	temper and habits of the people. Thrice
	happy man, that parish-priest, who feels
	the extent and importance of his duties,
	and performs them for their own reward,
	not as acts of drudgery, or to gratify
	selfish feelings! Enviable seat, that pulpit,
	where power is conferred by law and
	by custom, of teaching useful truths, and
	of conveying happiness, through the force
	of principles, to the fire-sides of so
	many families! Delightful picture!—what
	more, or what better, could wisdom contrive?—A
	day of rest—a place sanctified
	for instruction—habits of attendance—a
	teacher of worth and zeal—his precepts
	<a class="pagenum" id="page265" title="265"> </a>carried from the church to the fire-side—and
	there regulating and governing all the
	actions and relations of life!</p>

	<p>Such, however, is the composition of
	the picture, only as seen on a sunny day!
	Alas! the passions and weaknesses of men
	deny its frequent realization! Authorised
	instructors cannot enjoy the reputation of
	superior wisdom without being excited by
	vanity, and led to play the fool—they cannot
	understand two or three dialects without
	becoming coxcombs—they cannot wear
	a robe of office without being uplifted by
	pride—and they cannot be appointed expounders
	of the simple elements of morals,
	without fancying themselves in possession
	of <em>a second sight</em>, and discovering
	a <em>double</em> sense in every text of Scripture!
	From this weakness of human nature arise
	most of the mysteries which discredit religion,—hence
	the incomprehensible jargon
	of sects—hence the substitution of the shadow
	of faith for the substance of good
	works—hence the distraction of the people
	on theological subjects—and hence,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page266" title="266"> </a>in fine, its too common inefficacy and insufficiency
	in preserving public morals,
	evinced, among other bad effects, in its
	tolerance of vindictive Christian wars.</p>

	<p>I appeal, therefore, to conscientious
	teachers of the people, whether it is not
	their duty to avoid discussions in the
	pulpit on mysteries which never edify,
	because never understood; and to confine
	their discourses to such topics as those
	indicated in <em>the Sermon of Jesus on the
	Mount</em>. Such, at least, appears to be the
	proper duty of a national establishment!
	Empirics may raise the fury of fanaticism
	about mysteries with impunity—every absurdity
	may, for its season, be embodied
	in particular congregations—and infidelity,
	of all kinds, may be proclaimed at the corners
	of the streets without danger, provided
	the <strong class="special_emphasis">NATIONAL CHURCH</strong> be founded
	on the broad principles of virtue, and
	on the practice of those morals which are
	so beautifully expounded in the New Testament;
	and provided the parochial clergy
	do not mix themselves with those visionary
	<a class="pagenum" id="page267" title="267"> </a>topics which depend for success more
	on zeal and credulity, than on argument
	or reason. Such a church must flourish,
	as long as common sense, and a respect
	for virtue, govern the majority. In this
	view, I lament, however, that a revision
	has not taken place of those <em>articles of
	faith</em> which were promulgated in the sixteenth
	century, by men newly converted,
	and perhaps but half converted, from the
	Romish faith, and taught to a people
	then unprepared to receive all the changes
	which reason demanded. As a friend,
	therefore, to that religion which preserves
	the public morals, I hope to live to see
	many of those articles qualified which
	treat of mysteries conceived in the dark
	ages of monkish superstition, and countenanced
	by scholastic logic; considering
	that such qualification would probably
	lead to greater concord in matters of the
	highest importance to society, and serve
	to establish the Anglican Church on the
	immoveable bases of reason and truth.
	It seems, indeed, to be high time that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268"> </a>Protestant churches, of all denominations,
	should come to some agreement in regard
	to the full extent of the errors which,
	during twelve centuries, were introduced
	into the Christian religion by the craft
	or ignorance of the Church of Rome.
	Did the early reformers detect the whole
	of them? And, if in the opinion of
	discreet persons they did not, or, as is
	reasonable to suppose, they could not,
	is it not important to examine conscientious
	doubts, and to restore the religion
	of Christ, which we profess, to
	its original purity, and to <strong class="special_emphasis">THE ONLY
	STANDARD OF TRUTH</strong>, which God has
	given to man, <strong class="special_emphasis">THE LIGHT OF HIS EXPERIENCE
	AND REASON</strong>.</p>

	<p>Such were the considerations that forced
	themselves upon me, as I paced the aisles
	of this sanctuary of religion. Nor could
	I avoid reflecting on the false associations
	which early prejudices attach to such enclosures
	of four walls. By day, they are
	an object of veneration; by night, an
	object of terror. Perhaps no person in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269"> </a>Mortlake would singly pass a long night
	in this solemn structure, for the fee-simple
	of half the town! The objects of their
	fears none could, or would, justify; yet
	the anticipated horrors of passing a night
	in a church seems universal! Perhaps
	some expect, that the common elementary
	principles which once composed the
	bodies of the decomposed dead, would,
	for the occasion, be collected again from
	the general storehouse of the atmosphere
	and earth, and would exhibit themselves,
	on their re-organization, more hurtful
	than at first. Perhaps others expect that
	some of those unembodied spirits, with
	which mythology and priestcraft have in
	all ages deluded the vulgar,—though no
	credible evidence or natural probability
	was ever adduced of the existence or appearance
	of any such spirits,—would
	without bodies appear to their visual organs,
	and torment or injure them!—Yes—monstrous
	and absurd though it be—such
	are the prevalent weaknesses created
	by superstition, and wickedly instilled into
	<a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270"> </a>infant minds in the nursery, so as to govern
	the feelings and conduct of ninety-nine
	of every hundred persons in our comparatively
	enlightened society.</p>

	<p>It should now be well understood, that
	what is contrary to uniform experience
	ought to be no object of faith—consequently
	what no man ever saw, none
	need expect to see—and what never did
	harm, none need fear! In this view our
	poets might aid the work of public education,
	by dispensing with their machinery
	of ideal personages, as tending to keep
	alive that superstition, which a <em class="special_name">Wordsworth</em>
	has recently proved to be unnecessary,
	in a poem that rivals the efforts
	of the Rosicrucian school. Ought not
	the ghosts of Shakespeare to be <em>supposed</em>
	merely as the effects of diseased vision, or
	a guilty imagination? Ought an enlightened
	audience to tolerate the mischievous
	impressions produced on the minds of
	ignorance or youth by the gross exhibitions
	which now disgrace our stage in
	Hamlet, Richard, and Macbeth? We all
	<a class="pagenum" id="page271" title="271"> </a>know that fever of the brain produces
	successions of spectres or images, the result
	of diseased organs; but no one ever
	conceived that such melancholy effects of
	disease could be seen by healthy by-standers,
	till our stage-managers availed
	themselves of vulgar credulity, and dared
	to give substance to diseased ideas as a
	means of gratifying their avarice? If
	Shakespeare intended to give visible substance
	to his numerous ghosts, he merely
	conformed himself to the state of knowledge
	in his day, when Demonology was
	sanctioned by royal authority, and when
	the calendars at the assizes were filled
	with victims of superstition, under charges
	of witchcraft! It is, however, time that
	we banish such credulity from the minds
	even of the lowest vulgar, as disgraceful
	to religion, education, morals, and
	reason!</p>

	<p>Humanly speaking, I exclaimed—Am I
	not in the House of God? Is not this
	puny structure a tribute of man to the
	Architect of the Universe? What a lesson
	<a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272"> </a>for man’s pride!—look at this building,
	and behold the Universe! Man is but a
	point of infinite space, with intellectual
	powers, bound in their sphere of action
	to his body, and subject with it to the
	laws of motion and gravitation! For such
	a being this may properly be the house of
	God; but it ought never to be forgotten,
	that the only house of God is a universe
	as boundless as his powers, and as eternal
	as his existence! In relation to man and
	man’s pride, what a sublime and overwhelming
	contrast is presented by the
	everlasting <strong class="special_emphasis">NOW</strong>, and the universal <strong class="special_emphasis">HERE</strong>!
	Yet how can the creature of mere relations,
	who exists by generating time,
	space, and other sensations, conceive of
	the immutable <strong class="special_emphasis">CAUSE OF CAUSES</strong>, to
	whom his past and future, and his above
	and below, are as a <strong class="special_emphasis">SINGLE TOTALITY</strong>!
	Wisest of men is he who knows the
	most of such a Being; but, chained to a
	point, and governed in all our reasonings
	by mere relative powers, we can only
	conceive of <em>ubiquity</em> by the contrast of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273"> </a>our <em>locality</em>—of <em>infinity</em> by our <em>dimensions</em>—of
	<em>eternity</em> by our <em>duration</em>—and
	of <em>omniscience</em> by our <em>reason</em>! Creatures
	of yesterday, surrounded by blessings, it
	is natural we should inquire in regard to
	the origin and cause of the novel state
	in which we find ourselves; but the <em>finite</em>
	cannot reason on the <em>infinite</em>—the <em>transient</em>
	on the <em>eternal</em>—or the <em>local</em> on the
	<em>universal</em>; and on such subjects all we
	can ascertain, is the utter inadequacy of
	our powers to perceive them clearly. It
	seems, therefore, to be our duty to <strong class="special_emphasis">ENJOY</strong>,
	to <strong class="special_emphasis">WONDER</strong>, and to <strong class="special_emphasis">WORSHIP</strong>.</p>

	<p>On every side of me I beheld records
	of the wrecks of man, deposited here
	merely to increase the sympathy of the
	living for the place. Perhaps I was even
	breathing some of the gaseous effluvia
	which once composed their living bodies:
	but, the gas of a human body differing
	in no respect from the gas generated in
	the great laboratory of the earth’s surface,
	which I breathe hourly; and being in
	itself innoxious in quantity, if not in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274"> </a>quality, I felt no qualms from my consciousness
	of its source. The putrefactive
	process decomposes the bodies of all animals,
	and returns their generic principles
	to the common reservoirs of carbon, hydrogen,
	nitrogen, and oxygen: through
	life, the same process, varied in its proportions,
	is going forward; and the body
	is constantly resolving itself into the generic
	principles of nature, which generic
	principles again serve the purposes of
	respiration in other animals, and renew
	other existences as suitably as though
	they had never before been employed for
	the same purposes. Hence it is probable
	that the identical atoms composing any
	of the elements of nature, may have
	existed in hundreds of different animals
	in different ages of the world; and hence
	we arrive at a principle of metempsychosis,
	without entangling ourselves in
	the absurdities with which priestcraft
	among the Eastern nations has clothed
	and disguised it.</p>

	<p>Various tablets placed around the walls
	<a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275"> </a>record departed worth in many persons
	of distinction. I could find no memorials
	of the impostor <em class="special_name">Dee</em>, whose aged
	remains were deposited here. He was
	one of the last of the race of those men
	of science who made use of his knowledge
	to induce the vulgar to believe him a conjuror,
	or one possessed of the power of
	conversing with <strong class="special_emphasis">SPIRITS</strong>. His journals
	of this pretended intercourse were published
	after his death, by one of the Casaubons,
	in two folio volumes. Lilly’s
	Memoirs record many of his impostures,
	and there is no doubt but in his time the
	public mind was much agitated by his extravagancies.
	The mob more than once
	destroyed his house, for being familiar
	with their devil; and, what is more extraordinary,
	he was often consulted, and
	even employed in negociations, by Queen
	Elizabeth. He pretended to see spirits
	in a small stone, lately preserved with his
	papers in the British Museum. His spirits
	appear to have had bodies and garments
	thick enough to reflect rays of light, though
	<a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276"> </a>they passed freely in and out of his stone,
	and through the walls of his room; and
	organs for articulation, which they exercised
	within the glass! How slight an advance
	in knowledge exposes all such impostures!
	In his spiritual visions, Dee had a confederate
	of the name of Kelly, who, of
	course, confirmed all the oracles of his
	master. Both, however, in spite of their
	spiritual friends, died miserably—the man
	by leaping out of a window, and the
	master in great poverty. Dee is the less
	excusable, because he was a man of family
	and considerable learning, a fellow
	of Trinity-college, Cambridge, and a good
	mathematician. But, in an age in which
	one Queen imprisoned him for practising
	by enchantment against her life, and her
	successor required him to name a lucky
	day for her coronation, is it to be wondered
	that a mere man, like tens of thousands
	of our modern religious fanatics,
	persuaded himself that he was possessed
	of supernatural powers?</p>

	<p>Beneath the same pavement, resolved
	<a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277"> </a>into kindred elements, though when in
	chemical union so different a totality, lie
	the remains of that illustrious patriot, Sir

	the ministers of the first and second of the

	London, would attest his worth,
	if the same area was not disgraced by
	another, of the infamous Charles the Second,

	vice. Sir John, like Alderman Barber,
	acquired fame by his opposition to the
	Excise Laws, and by other exertions in

		<p>That grace and beauty, form’d each heart to win,</p>
		<p>Seem’d but the casket to the gem within:</p>
		<p>Not hence the fond presumption of our love,</p>

		<p>But that pure Piety’s consoling pow’r</p>
		<p>Thy life illum’d, and cheer’d thy parting hour;</p>
		<p>That each best gift of charity was thine,</p>
		<p>The liberal feeling and the grace divine;</p>

	<p>Whenever the remains of the lord of
	this amiable woman are deposited on
	the same spot, I venture humbly and
	respectfully to suggest, that the tablet to
	his memory should include a copy of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page279" title="279"> </a>most eventful document of his life and
	times. He was prime-minister when, in
	March 1803, the ever-to-be-lamented
	message charging the French with making
	extensive military preparations in the
	ports of France and Holland, was advised
	by the ministry to be sent to both
	Houses of Parliament. During the past
	year he had obtained the glory of concluding
	a treaty which restored tranquillity
	to a suffering world; and yet the virulence
	of a contemptible Opposition, and
	the empirical pretensions of an Ex-minister,
	led him and his colleagues tardily
	to execute the article which was to restore
	Malta to its Knights. A demand
	that this article should be executed, led
	to discussions since made public, but
	which, in my opinion, have not justified the
	character given of them in the message.
	Nor does it appear that the English ambassador
	at Paris had inquired or remonstrated
	with the French Government
	on the subject of the pretended military
	preparations. The flame, however, was
	<a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280"> </a>thus kindled, which spread in due time
	from kingdom to kingdom; covering the
	whole earth with blood and desolation,
	wasting millions of lives in battle, siege,
	imprisonment, or massacre; and transferring
	all the rentals and industry of the
	people of England to the public creditors,
	to pay the interest of loans and other
	consequent obligations of the state!</p>

	<p>Unhappily the <strong class="special_emphasis">GENIUS</strong> of <strong class="special_emphasis">TRUTH</strong> was
	hoodwinked at the time, by the general
	corruption of the press; and the <strong class="special_emphasis">SPIRIT</strong>
	of <strong class="special_emphasis">PATRIOTISM</strong> was overawed by the
	passionate clamours of a whole people
	to be avenged for various alledged affronts!
	But at this distance of time these
	are merely topics for the lamentation of
	history! It is now, I fear, too late to institute
	legislative inquiries; but the case
	will remain as a beacon to all people, who
	should be taught by it to consider ministers
	of the Crown, though as amiable in
	private life as an <em class="special_name">Addington</em>, as fallible
	men, liable to be misled by intrigue or passion,
	and therefore, in a public sense, not
	<a class="pagenum" id="page281" title="281"> </a>to be <em>credited</em> without other evidence than
	their own assertions. Let an exemplary
	<strong class="special_emphasis">INSCRIPTION</strong> on the tomb of the minister
	of that day serve therefore to teach
	all ministers, never wilfully to depart in the
	most indifferent act of public policy from
	<strong class="special_emphasis">THE TRUTH</strong>; and warn them to pause before
	they commit the extensive interests
	of nations, while they or the people are
	under the influence of passion. Alas!
	what frightful mischiefs might have been
	averted if these considerations had governed
	the English people, or the English ministry,
	during the fatal discussions of Lord
	Whitworth at Paris!</p>

	<p>In charity, I hope the Ministry believed
	that this dispute might have ended with
	a mere demonstration; and I admit that
	no man can foresee all the consequences
	of an action: yet, as the feelings which
	excited that message and directed those
	deliberations, continued to influence the
	Ministry during twelve years warfare,
	and led to the rejection of seven overtures
	for peace, made at different times by
	<em class="special_name">Napoleon</em>; the character of the age
	<a class="pagenum" id="page282" title="282"> </a>and the future security of the world
	against wars of aggression, seem to require
	that the origin of the late war
	should even yet become an object of solemn
	parliamentary inquiry. The Crown
	may have the constitutional power of declaring
	war, but the ministers of the
	Crown are responsible for the abuse of
	that power; and let it be remembered, that
	the origin of every war is easily tried by
	tests to be found in <em class="special_name">Grotius</em>, <em class="special_name">Puffendorf</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Vattel</em>, or other authorities on
	the laws of nations; and that, without the
	combination of justice and necessity in its
	origin, no true glory can be acquired in
	its progress or in its results.<a href="#footnote_6" id="fnm6" title="While these pages were printing..." class="fnmarker">6</a></p>

	<p>I learnt with regret that the improved
	<a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283"> </a>Psalmody of <em class="special_name">Gardiner</em> had not yet
	been introduced into the service of this
	<a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284"> </a>church, and that the drawling-monkish
	tunes are preferred to those sublime passages
	of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven,
	which that gentleman has so ingeniously
	adapted to the Psalms of David.
	It might have been expected that every
	church in the enlightened vicinage of the
	metropolis would, ere this, have adopted
	a means of exalting the spirit of devotion,
	which has received the high sanction of
	the Regent and the Archbishop of Canterbury,
	and which exhibits among its
	patrons nearly the whole bench of bishops.
	I suspect, indeed, that the <em>shops</em> of the
	mere trading Methodists attract as many
	auditors by their singing as by their
	preaching; consequently, enlarged churches
	and improved psalmody would serve to
	protect many of the people from becoming
	the dupes of that <strong class="special_emphasis">CANT</strong> and <strong class="special_emphasis">CRAFT</strong> of
	<strong class="special_emphasis">FANATICISM</strong>, which is so disgraceful to
	the age, so dangerous to religion, and
	so inimical to the progress of truth and
	knowledge.</p>

	<p>Viewing this church in a statistical
	point of view, I counted 85 pews, capable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285"> </a>of holding about 550 persons, and I learnt
	that about 100 charity-school and other
	children sit in the aisles. Hence, perhaps,
	600 attend each service; and, if
	300 attend in the afternoon who do not
	in the morning, then we may calculate
	the attendants on the church-service, in
	this parish, at about 900. The population
	is, however, about 2100; from which,
	deducting 300 children, it will appear that
	half the inhabitants are dissenters, methodists,
	or indifferents. Of these, about
	200 belong to a chapel for the Independents,
	and perhaps others attend favourite
	preachers in the vicinity. Such are the
	religious divisions of this parish; yet, as
	there are no manufactories, and the clergyman
	is well respected, the attendants on
	the Church may be considered as above
	even the general average of the Establishment
	in other parishes.</p>

	<p>I was induced to ascend into the belfry,
	where I found ropes for eight bells—those
	musical tones, which extend the
	sphere of the Church’s influence, by associations
	<a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286"> </a>of pleasure, devotion, or melancholy,
	through the surrounding country.
	What an effective means of increasing
	the sympathies of religion, and exciting
	them by the fire-sides, and on the very
	pillows of the people! Who that, as
	bride or bridegroom, has heard them, in
	conjunction with the first joys of wedded
	love, does not feel the pleasurable associations
	of their lively peal on other similar
	events? Who, that through a series
	of years has obeyed their calling chime on
	the Sabbath morning, as the signal of
	placid feelings towards his God, and his
	assembled neighbours, does not hear their
	weekly monotony with devotion? And
	who is there that has performed the last
	rites of friendship, or the melancholy duties
	of son, daughter, husband, wife,
	father, mother, brother, or sister, under
	the recurring tones of the awful Tenor,
	or more awful Dumb-peal, and does not
	feel, at every recurrence of the same
	ceremony, a revival of his keen, but unavailing,
	regrets for the mouldering dead?
	<a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287"> </a>Thus does art play with our ingenuous
	feelings; and thus is an importance given
	to the established Church in the concords
	of man’s nervous system, which renders
	it unnecessary for its priesthood to
	be jealous or invidious towards those who
	dissent from its doctrines for conscience
	sake. In truth, such is the imposing attitude
	of the national Church, that, if
	the members leave the Church to sit
	under strange pulpits, the incumbent
	should suspect his doctrines, his zeal,
	his talents, or his charity in the collection
	of his dues and tithes. What but
	gross misconduct in the priest—what
	but doctrines incompatible with the intelligence
	of an enlightened age—or what
	but the odious impost of tithes-in-kind,
	can separate the people from the building
	where they first heard the name of God,
	and which contains the bones of their
	ancestors?</p>

	<p>In conceding to the influence of bells
	so many services to the establishment
	which monopolizes them, I must, however,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288"> </a>not forget that the power they possess
	over the nerves, however agreeable
	or interesting in health, is pernicious, and
	often fatal, when the excitability is increased
	by disease? What medicine can
	allay the fever which is often exasperated
	by their clangor? What consoling hope
	can he feel who, while gasping for breath,
	or fainting from debility, hears a knell,
	in which he cannot but anticipate his
	own?—Hundreds are thus murdered in
	great cities every year by noisy peals or
	unseasonable knells. Sleep, the antidote
	of diseased action, is destroyed by the one;
	and Hope, the first of cordials, is extinguished
	by the other. The interesting
	sympathies and services of bells appear to
	be, therefore, too dearly purchased. In all
	countries, death-knells and funeral-tollings
	ought to be entirely abolished; and even
	the ringing of peals should be liable to be
	interdicted, at the request of any medical
	practitioner. Nor ought the sanctuaries
	of the professed religion of peace and
	charity to be disgraced at any time, by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page289" title="289"> </a>celebrations of those murderous conflicts
	between man and man, which too often
	take place, to gratify the malice and pride
	of <strong class="special_emphasis">WEAK PRINCES</strong>, or sustain the avarice
	and false calculations of their <strong class="special_emphasis">WICKED
	MINISTERS</strong>. Even in justifiable wars of
	self-defence, such as the resistance to the
	unprincipled invasion of William the Norman,
	or of the English people against the
	tyrannical Charles, the church of Christ
	ought only to mourn at the unhappy price
	of the most decisive victory.</p>

	<p>The solemn tick of the parish-clock reminding
	me of the progress of the day, I
	hastened down the worn stairs, which indicated
	the busy steps of generations long
	returned to their gazeous elements, into
	the church-yard. The all-glorious sun,
	mocking the fate of mortals, still shed a
	fascinating lustre on the southern fields,
	and reminded me, that the village on my
	left was the eastern <em class="special_name">Sheen</em>, so called
	from the very effect which I witnessed.
	Several pretty mansions skirted the fields,
	and the horizon was beautifully filled by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290"> </a>the well-grown woods of Richmond Park,
	the walls of which were but half a mile
	distant. The path across the meadow
	would have tempted me to enjoy its rare
	beauty; but my course lay westward, and
	I turned from this brilliant scenery of
	Nature to the homely creations of man
	in the village street.</p>

	<p>Contemptibly as I think of the morals
	of Dee, yet, as an able mathematician
	and an extraordinary character, I could
	not resist my curiosity to view the house
	in which he resided. It is now a Ladies’
	boarding-school; and, on explaining the
	purpose of my visit, I was politely shown
	through the principal rooms. In two
	hundred years, it has of course undergone
	considerable alterations: yet parts
	of it still exhibit the architecture of the
	sixteenth century. From the front windows
	I was shown Dee’s garden, on the
	other side of the road, still attached to the
	house; down the central path of which,
	through iron gates, yet standing, Queen
	Elizabeth used to walk from her carriage
	<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291"> </a>in the Sheen road, to consult the
	wily conjurer on affairs of love and war.</p>

	<p>I found the gouvernante of this establishment
	perfectly intelligent on the subject
	of her proper business. Her unaffected
	politeness induced me to take a
	chair and recruit my strength with a
	glass of water and a crust of bread. We
	talked on Education, and particularly on
	that of females. She agreed that a female
	pedant is at best a ridiculous character,
	and that retired graces, personal
	accomplishments, and useful domestic
	acquirements, are best adapted to the
	destiny of woman. We approved of
	dancing, because it affords social recreation
	and wholesome exercise; and of
	music, for its own sake, and as a means
	of relieving the monotony of the domestic
	circle in long evenings and bad
	weather. She considered the study of
	a foreign language to be partly necessary,
	as a means of acquiring exact ideas
	of the science of language generally;
	and we agreed in preferring the French,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292"> </a>for its conversational powers and its
	universality as a living tongue. Nor
	did we differ in our views of the necessity
	of making the future companions
	of well-educated men intimately acquainted
	with the leading facts of geography
	and history, and with the general principles
	of natural philosophy and chemistry.
	I ventured to suggest, that the great
	objection to female boarding-schools, the
	neglect of the arts of housewifery might
	be obviated, by causing two of the pupils,
	of a certain age, to assist in the management
	of the store-room and kitchen
	for a week in rotation, during which
	they should fill up the items of the house-keeper’s
	account-book, and make purchases
	of the family tradesmen. At
	this the good lady smiled—Ah, sir, (said
	she,) yours is a plausible theory, but
	not one mother in ten would tolerate
	a practice which they would consider as
	a degradation of their daughters.—But,
	(said I,) is not household economy the
	chief pursuit of nine of every ten of the
	sex; and is not the system of education
	<a class="pagenum" id="page293" title="293"> </a>incomplete, if not a waste of time, which
	does not embrace that pursuit as part
	of the plan? And just for that reason,
	(said she,) that one in every ten may
	not have occasion to concern herself in
	household affairs, the whole avoid them
	as degrading—each looks for the prize
	in the lottery of fortune, and therefore
	all pitch themselves too high—and it
	would be offensive to the pride and vanity
	of parents, to suppose that their daughter
	might have occasion to know any thing of
	the vulgar employments of the house and
	the kitchen.—It is the parents, then, (said
	I, in conclusion,) who require instruction
	as much as their children.—We agreed,
	however, in our estimate of the superior
	advantages which children of both sexes
	enjoy in the present day, from the improved
	and extended views of the authors
	of school-books. She was warm in her
	praises of the Interrogative System of
	some recent authors; and I found she
	was no stranger to the merits of the Universal
	Preceptor, and of the elementary
	<a class="pagenum" id="page294" title="294"> </a>Grammars of Geography, History, and
	Natural Philosophy.</p>

	<p>As I continued my course towards
	the site of the ancient residence of the
	Archbishops of Canterbury, which lies at
	the western extremity of the village, I
	could not avoid asking myself, how, in
	a country abounding in such means of instruction,
	political fraud has continued so
	successful? Has education yet effected
	nothing for mankind, <em>owing to its servility
	to power</em>? Is the press but a more effective
	engine for promulgating sophistry,
	<em>owing to its ready corruption</em>? Is religion
	in the pulpit but a plausible means
	of palliating the crimes of statesmen, <em>owing
	to the ambition of its professors</em>? Would
	it now be possible to poison Socrates,
	banish Aristides, and crucify Jesus, for
	teaching truth and practising virtue? Alas!
	a respect for that same truth compelled
	me to say, Yes!—Yes, said I, there never
	was a country, nor an age, in which artful
	misrepresentation could be more successfully
	practised than at this day in Britain!
	Can the <em>press</em> effectually sustain truth,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page295" title="295"> </a>while no penal law prevents the purse and
	patronage of ministers and magistrates
	from poisoning its channels of communication
	with the people? Can the <em>pulpit</em>
	be expected to advocate political truth,
	while the patronage of the Church is in the
	hands of the Administration of the day?
	Can <em>education</em> itself be free from the influence
	of corrupt patronage, or the force
	of numerous prejudices, while an abject
	conformity to the opinions of each previous
	age is the passport to all scholastic dignities?
	Does any established or endowed
	school, and do any number even of private
	schools, make it part of their professed
	course to teach their pupils the value of
	freedom, the duties of freemen, and the
	free principles of the British constitution?
	Is the system of the public schools, where
	our statesmen and legislators are educated,
	addressed to the <strong class="special_emphasis">HEART</strong> as well as the
	<strong class="special_emphasis">HEAD</strong>? Is poverty any where more degraded;
	cruelty to the helpless animal
	creation any where more remorselessly
	practised; or the pride of pedantry, and the
	vain-glory of human learning, any where
	<a class="pagenum" id="page296" title="296"> </a>more vaunted? In short, are the vices of
	gluttony, drunkenness, pugilism, and prodigality,
	any where more indulged? Yet,
	may we not say, as in the days of William
	of Wykeham, that “<em>Manners make the
	man!</em>”—and, on the subject of public duties,
	might we not derive a lesson even
	from the ancient institutions of Lycurgus?</p>

	<p>The best hopes of society are the progressive
	improvement of succeeding generations,
	and the prospect that each will
	add something to the stock of knowledge
	to that which went before it. But gloomy
	is the perspective, if the science of education
	be rendered stationary or retrograde
	by the iron hand of power and bigotry,
	and if errors by these means are propagated
	from age to age with a species of accelerated
	force. Yet, what signs of improvement
	are visible in our public schools,
	wherein are educated those youths who
	are destined to direct the fortunes of Britain
	in each succeeding age? Most of
	these schools were endowed at the epoch
	of the revival of learning; yet the exact
	<a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297"> </a>course of instruction which was prescribed
	by the narrow policy of that comparatively
	dark age, is slavishly followed even to this
	hour! Instead of knowledge, moral and
	physical, being taught in them, as the true
	end of all education,—those dead languages,
	which in the 15th and 16th centuries were
	justly considered as the fountains of wisdom,
	are still exclusively taught; as though
	the English language, now, as then, contained
	no works of taste and information
	on a par with those of the ancients; and
	as though such writers as Bacon, Shakespeare,
	Milton, Newton, Locke, Addison,
	Pope, Johnson, Blackstone, Hume, Robertson,
	and Blair, had never lived! Is it
	not to mistake the means for the end, to
	teach any language, except as the medium
	of superior philosophy? And is it not a
	false inference, to ascribe exclusively to the
	study of languages, those habits of industrious
	application, which would grow with
	equal certainty out of the study of the
	useful sciences, if pursued with the same
	system, and for a similar period of time?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298"> </a>Reason demands, however, on this subject,
	those concessions from the <strong class="special_emphasis">PRIDE</strong> of
	<strong class="special_emphasis">PEDANTRY</strong> which that pride will never
	yield. We seem, therefore, to be destined,
	by the force of circumstances, to
	make slow or inconsiderable advances in
	civilization; and it remains for other nations,
	the bases of whose institutions are
	less entangled in prejudices, to raise the
	condition of man higher in the scale of
	improvement than can be expected in
	Britain. We may, as a result of geographical
	position, attain a certain degree of
	national distinction; but, if our system of
	public education cannot be made to keep
	pace with knowledge, and is not calculated
	to generate a succession of patriots, who
	are qualified to sustain liberty at home and
	justice abroad, we cannot fail to sink in
	our turn to the level of modern Egypt,
	Greece, and Italy. Those hotbeds of
	human genius were ultimately degraded
	by the triumph of prejudices over principles,
	by the extinction of public spirit, by
	the preference of despotism over liberty,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299"> </a>and by the glare of foreign conquests.
	The countries, the soil, and even the cities
	remain; but, as their youth are no longer
	trained in the love of truth and liberty,
	they exist but as beacons to warn other
	people of their fall and its causes.</p>

	<p>I turned aside to view a manufactory of
	Delft and Stone ware, for which, among
	potters, Mortlake is famous. A silly air
	of mystery veiled these work-shops from
	public view; and, as I professed mine to
	be a visit of mere curiosity, the conductor’s
	taciturnity increased with the variety
	of my unsatisfied questions. It was in
	vain I assured him that I was no potter—that
	experimental philosophy and chemistry
	had stript empiricism of its garb—and
	that no secret, worth preserving, could
	long be kept in a manufactory which employed
	a dozen workmen, at 20<i>s.</i> a week.
	The principal articles made here are
	those brown stone jugs, of which the song
	tells us, one was made of the clay of Toby
	Filpot; and I could not help remarking, that
	the groups on these jugs are precisely those
	<a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300"> </a>on the common pottery of the Romans.
	I learnt, however, that the patterns employed
	here are not copied from the antique,
	but from those used at Delft, of which
	this manufactory is a successful imitation
	in every particular: and perhaps the
	Delft manufactory itself is but a continuation
	of a regular series of stone or earthenware
	manufactories, from the age of
	the Romans. Each may have continued
	to imitate the approved ornaments of its
	predecessors, till we trace in the productions
	of this contemporary pottery, the
	patterns used by the nations of antiquity
	when just emerging from barbarism.
	Hunting, the most necessary of arts to the
	vagrant and carnivorous savage, is the employment
	celebrated on all these vessels,
	A stag, followed by ferocious quadrupeds
	and hungry bipeds, forms their general
	ornament. I have picked up the same
	groups among Roman ruins, have often
	contemplated them in the cabinets of the
	curious, and here I was amused at viewing
	them in creations but a week old.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page301" title="301"> </a>To take off ornamental impressions on
	plastic clay, was a contrivance which
	would present itself to the first potters—but
	perhaps it was the foundation of all
	our proud arts of sculpture, painting,
	hieroglyphic design, writing, seal-engraving,
	and, finally, of printing and copper-plate
	engraving! What an interesting
	series!—But I solemnly put the question,
	Have we arrived at the last of its terms?
	Is the series capable of no further application,
	extension, or variation? Have we
	conceived the utmost limits of its abstractions?
	Have we examined the powers of
	all its terms with equal care? In one sense,
	we may never get beyond a Phidias or a
	Canova—in another, beyond a Woollet
	or a Bartolozzi—or, in a third, beyond a
	Corregio or a David;—but have we sufficiently
	examined and husbanded the abstractions
	of Thoth or Cadmus?—Ought
	not the signs of ideas, ere this, to have
	become abstract representations; as universal
	in their signification as ideas themselves?—Ought
	we to be obliged to study
	<a class="pagenum" id="page302" title="302"> </a>all languages and many characters, in
	order to comprehend the ideas which are
	common to the whole human race? Are
	ideas more numerous than musical sounds,
	and tones, and tunes? Do not the powers
	of musical characters and of the telegraph
	prove the facility and capacity of very simple
	combinations? Does not the Christmas
	game of <em>Twenty</em> indicate the narrow
	range of all our ideas? And is not a fact
	thereby ascertained, from which we may
	conceive the practicability of so combining
	hieroglyphic with arbitrary characters, as
	to be able to read men’s ideas without the
	intervention of a hundred tongues?</p>

	<p>On leaving this manufactory, I proceeded
	about a hundred yards, through
	the main street; and, turning a corner on
	the right, beheld the ancient gateway, now
	bricked up, and the ruined walls of an
	enclosure, sanctified, during five centuries,
	as the residence of thirty-four successors
	to the see of Canterbury. Learning that
	the enclosure was occupied by a market-gardener,
	I could not avoid observing,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303"> </a>as a proof of the sagacity of gardeners,
	and of the luxury which manured these
	sites, that I have seldom visited decayed
	religious houses without finding them in
	possession of market-gardeners! Ah!
	thought I, as I stopped before the gate, how
	many thousands of rich donations used
	to be brought to that portico by superstitious
	votaries, who considered it as the
	emblem of the gate of St. Peter, and believed
	that, if welcomed at the one, they
	should be equally welcomed at the other!
	Poor souls—they and their spiritual protectors
	have alike passed away—and we
	can now look with the eye of Philosophy
	on the impotent impostures of one party,
	and on the unsuspecting credulity of the
	other!</p>

	<p>I was in haste—-yet I could not avoid
	stopping five minutes—yes, reader, and it
	is a lesson to human pomp—I could wait
	but five minutes to contemplate the gate
	through which had passed thirty-four successive
	Archbishops of Canterbury, from
	Anselm, in the time of William the Norman,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page304" title="304"> </a>to Warham and Cranmer, the pliant
	tools of the tyrant Tudor. As leaders of
	the Catholic Church, we may now, in this
	Protestant country, speak, without offence,
	of their errors and vices. Ambition
	and the exercise of power were doubtless
	the ruling passions of the majority,
	who have shown themselves little scrupulous
	as to the means by which those passions
	might be gratified;—yet it would be
	uncandid not to admit that many men, like
	the present amiable Protestant archbishop,
	have filled this See, whose eminent virtue,
	liberality, and piety, were their principal
	recommendations—and who doubtless believed
	all those articles of the Church’s
	faith which they taught to others. They
	were, in truth, wheels of a machine which
	existed before their time; and they honestly
	performed the part assigned them, without
	disputing its origin or the sources of
	its powers; prudently considering that, if
	they endeavoured to pull it in pieces, they
	were likely themselves to become the first
	victims of their temerity. Thus doubtless it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page305" title="305"> </a>was with Cicero and the philosophers of
	antiquity; they found theological machinery
	powerful enough to govern society; and
	though, on the subject of the Gods, they
	prudently conformed, or were silent, yet
	we are not at this day warranted in supposing
	that they obsequiously reverenced
	the absurd theology of the romance of
	Homer. Of the archbishops who have
	passed this gate, St. Thomas à Becket
	was perhaps the greatest bigot; but the
	exaltation of the ecclesiastical over the
	temporal power was the fashion of his
	day; and obedience and allegiance could
	scarcely be expected of a clergy who,
	owing all their dignities to the Pope, owned
	no authority superior to that of the
	keeper of Peter’s Keys to the Gates of
	Heaven!</p>

	<p>I could not, even in thus transiently
	glancing at these meagre remains, avoid
	the interesting recollection, that this portico
	once served as a sanctuary for the contrition
	of guilt against the unsparing malignity
	of law. In those days, when bigotry
	<a class="pagenum" id="page306" title="306"> </a>courted martyrdom as a passport to
	eternal glory, and when, in consequence,
	the best principle of religion was enabled
	to triumph over the malice of weak princes
	and the tyranny of despots, this gate (said
	I) served as one of many avenues to the
	emblem of that Divinity to whom the interior
	was devoted. It justly asserted the
	authority of the religion of charity, whose
	Founder ordered his disciples to pardon
	offences, though multiplied seventy times
	seven times. Yet, alas! in our days, how
	much is this divine precept forgotten! Is
	not the sanguinary power of law suffered
	to devour its victims for <em>first</em> relapses from
	virtue, as unsparingly as for any number
	of repetitions? Do not its sordid agents
	exult in the youth or inexperience of offenders,
	and often receive contrition and
	confession as aggravating proofs of more
	deliberate turpitude? Has not the modern
	sanctuary of Mercy long been shut, by
	forms of state, against the personal supplications
	of repentance, and against humble
	representations of venial errors of criminal
	<a class="pagenum" id="page307" title="307"> </a>courts? If sinners would approach
	that gate, are they not stopped at the very
	threshold, and obliged to rely on the intercession
	of some practised minister, or
	seek the good offices of illiberal clerks? Is
	this Christendom, the volume of whose
	faith tells its votaries to knock without
	fear at the gate of Mercy, and it shall be
	opened by an Heavenly Father?—or England,
	where a solemn law enacts, that it
	is the right of the subject to petition the
	King, and that all commitments and prosecutions
	for such petitioning are illegal?—or
	civilized Europe, where it has so often
	been asserted that the receiving of petitions,
	and granting their prayer, is the
	most enviable branch of royal prerogative?
	Alas! will the golden mean of reason
	never govern the practices of men?
	Must we for ever be the dupes of superstition,
	or the slaves of upstart authority?
	Are we doomed never to enjoy, in the
	ascendancy of our benevolent sympathies,
	a medium between the bigotry of the
	<em class="special_name">Crozier</em>, the pride of the <em class="special_name">Sceptre</em>, and
	the cruelty of the <em class="special_name">Sword</em>?</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page308" title="308"> </a>Nor ought it to be forgotten, that the
	benevolence which flowed from this portico,
	served as a substitute for the poor’s-rates,
	throughout the adjoining district.
	Thus <em class="special_name">Food</em>, as well as <em class="special_name">Mercy</em>, appeared
	to flow from Heaven, through the
	agency of the Romish priesthood! Thus
	they softened the effects of the monopolies
	of wealth, and assuaged the severities of
	power! And thus, duration was conferred
	on a system which violated common sense
	in its tenets; but, in its practices, exhibited
	every claim on the affections and gratitude
	of the people! At this gate, and
	at a thousand others spread over the land,
	no poor man sought to satisfy his hunger
	in vain. He was not received by any grim-visaged
	overseer; not called on for equivocal
	proofs of legal claims; not required to
	sell his liberty in the workhouse as the
	price of a single meal; not terrified by
	the capricious justice of a vulgar constable;
	nor in fear of the infernal machine,
	called a pass-cart—but it was sufficient
	that he was an hungered, and they gave
	<a class="pagenum" id="page309" title="309"> </a>him to eat—or that he was sick, and they
	gave him medicine! Such was the system
	of those times; not more perfect for being
	ancient, but worthy of being remembered,
	because justified by long experience.
	Thrice the relative wealth, and as much
	active benevolence, are at this day exerted
	to relieve the still unsatisfied wants of the
	poor, simply because our workhouses are
	not regularly provided with an hospitable
	monastic portico, where temporary wants
	might be supplied with a wholesome meal,
	without the formality of regular admission,
	without proofs of settlement, without the
	terrors of the House of Correction, or the
	horrors of a <em>middle-passage</em> in the pass-cart!
	The tenderest sympathy would then
	be able to excuse itself from the obligation
	of granting eleemosynary aid—the act of
	begging might be justly punished as a
	crime—and crimes themselves could never
	be palliated by pleas of urgent want.</p>

	<p>This entire site was too much consecrated
	by historical associations to be passed
	without further examination. A slight
	<a class="pagenum" id="page310" title="310"> </a>expression of my feelings procured every
	attention from Penley, the gardener, who
	told me that his family had occupied it
	since the revolution, and that he remembered
	every part above fifty years. He
	took me to a summer-house, on the wall
	next the water, the ruins of which were of
	the architecture of the time of the Plantagenets;
	and, indeed, the entire wall,
	above half a mile in circuit, was of that
	age. Of the ancient palace no vestige remained;
	and he could guess its precise
	site only by means of the masses of brickwork
	which he discovered by digging in
	certain parts of the garden.</p>

	<p>If I was, however, little gratified by
	remains of the labours of man, I was filled
	with astonishment at certain specimens of
	vegetation, unquestionably as ancient as
	the last Catholic archbishops. Among
	these were two enormous walnut-trees,
	twelve feet round the trunk, the boughs of
	which were themselves considerable trees,
	spreading above twenty-six yards across.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page311" title="311"> </a>Each tree covered above a rood of ground;
	and so massy were the lower branches,
	that it has been found necessary to support
	them with props. Their height is equal
	to their breadth, or about seventy feet;
	and I was surprised to find, that, notwithstanding
	their undoubted age, they still
	bear abundance of fine fruit. Mr. Penley
	assured me, that in his time he had seen
	no variation in them; they had doubtless
	attained their full growth in his boyhood,
	but since then they had maintained a
	steady maturity. At present they must be
	considered as in a state of slow decay;
	but I have no doubt that in the year 1916
	they will continue grand and productive
	trees.</p>

	<p>I was equally struck with some box-trees,
	probably of far greater antiquity.
	They were originally planted in a semicircle
	to serve as an arbour; but in the progress
	of centuries they have grown to the
	prodigious height of thirty feet, and their
	trunks are from six to nine inches in diameter.<a href="#footnote_7" id="fnm7" title="The box-wood used in England..." class="fnmarker">7</a>
	<a class="pagenum" id="page312" title="312"> </a>And what was strikingly curious,
	in the area which they enclose is seen the
	oval table of the arbour, evidently of the
	same age. It is of the species of stone
	called Plymouth marble,—massy, and so
	well-wrought as to prove that it was not
	placed there at the cost of private revenues.
	It was interesting, and even affecting,
	to behold these signs of comfort and
	good cheer still remaining, so many ages
	after those who enjoyed them have passed
	away like exhalations or transient meteors!
	I would have sat down, and, with a better
	conscience than Don Juan, have invoked
	<a class="pagenum" id="page313" title="313"> </a>their ghosts over a bottle of the honest
	gardener’s currant-wine; but he had filled
	up the elliptical area of the trees with a
	pile of fagots, of which the old table serves
	as a dry basement.</p>

	<p>What was less wonderful, though to the
	full as interesting—was the circumstance
	that the gardener has, at different times, in
	digging up the roots of his old fruit-trees,
	found them imbedded in skeletons of persons
	who were interred in or near the
	chapel of the archbishops. He told me,
	that a short time before my visit, in removing
	a pear-tree, he had taken up three
	perfect skeletons; and that one of them
	was pronounced by a surgeon in the neighbourhood
	to be the frame-work of a man
	full seven feet high. This probably was
	an accidental circumstance; for it is not to
	be supposed that any of the interments on
	this spot took place in those rude ages
	when bulk and stature led to rank and
	distinction, and, by consequence, to costly
	funerals and encasements of stone,
	which often surprize us with specimens of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page314" title="314"> </a>an apparently gigantic race. Doubtless,
	however, here were interred hundreds of
	pious persons, who calculated, in their
	last moments, on the protection of this
	consecrated ground till “the Earth should
	be called to give up its Dead;” and now,
	owing to the unsatisfied passion which the
	first “Defender of the Faith” felt for Anna
	Boleyn, this consecrated spot, and a thousand
	similar ones, have been converted
	into cabbage-gardens!</p>

	<p>Perhaps more than one archbishop,
	many bishops, and scores of deans, angelic
	doctors, and other reverend personages,
	lie in this now profaned and dishonoured
	spot! So great an outrage might,
	one would have supposed, have led them,
	according to ordinary notions, again to
	walk the earth, to despoil the garden, and
	disturb the gardener’s rest! I expressed
	my fears on this point to the worthy man;
	but he assured me, these good gentlefolks
	lie very quiet; and that, if they produced
	any visible effect, it was as manure, in
	rendering the part where they lie a little
	<a class="pagenum" id="page315" title="315"> </a>more productive than the other parts. I
	shuddered at this lesson of humility—Alas!
	thought I, is it for such ends that we pamper
	ourselves—that some of us boast of
	being better than others—that we seek
	splendid houses and superfine clothing—and
	render our little lives wretched by
	hunting after rank, and titles, and riches!
	After all, we receive a sumptuous funeral,
	and are affectionately laid in what is called
	consecrated ground, which some political
	revolution, or change of religion, converting
	into a market-garden, our bodies
	then serve but as substitutes for vulgar
	manure! If such an end of the illustrious
	and proud men, whose remains now fertilize
	this garden, had been contemplated
	by them, how truly would they have become
	disciples of the humble Jesus—and
	how horror-struck would they have been
	at the fantastic airs which, in their lives,
	they were giving themselves!—Yet, is there
	a reader of these pages, the end of whose
	mortal career may not be similar to theirs?—and
	ought he not to apply to himself
	<a class="pagenum" id="page316" title="316"> </a>the lesson thus taught by the known
	fate of the former inhabitants of the archiepiscopal
	palace of Mortlake?</p>

	<p>I shook my head at Penley, and told
	him, that he was a terrible “leveller,” and
	that, in making manure of archbishops
	and bishops, he was one of the most effective
	moralists I had ever conversed with!</p>

	<p>In walking round this garden, every
	part proved that its soil had been enriched
	from all the neighbouring lands. Whether,
	according to Dr. <em class="special_name">Creighton</em>, there are
	classes of organic particles adapted to form
	vegetables and animals over and over
	again; or whether, according to the modern
	chemistry, all organized bodies consist
	of carbonaceous, metallic, and gaseous
	substances in varied combinations; it is
	certain, that the well-fed priesthood, who
	formerly dwelt within these walls, drew
	together for ages such a supply of the
	pabulum of vegetation, as will require
	ages to exhaust. All the trees of this
	garden are of the most luxuriant size:
	gooseberries and currants in other gardens
	<a class="pagenum" id="page317" title="317"> </a>grow as shrubs; but here they form trees
	of four or five feet in height, and a circumference
	of five or six yards. In
	short, a luxuriance approaching to rankness,
	and a soil remarkable for its depth
	of colour and fatness, characterize every
	part. The abundant produce, as is usual
	through all this neighbourhood, is conveyed
	to Covent-Garden market in the night,
	and there disposed of by salesmen that
	attend on behalf of the gardeners.</p>

	<p>I took my departure from this inclosure
	with emotions that can only be felt. I
	looked again and again across the space
	which, during successive ages, had given
	birth to so many feelings, and nurtured so
	many anxious passions; but which now,
	for many ages, has, among bustling generations,
	lost all claim to sympathy or notice;
	and displays, at this day, nothing but
	the still mechanism of vegetable life. There
	might be little in the past to rouse the affections;
	but, in the difference of manners,
	there was much to amuse the imagination.
	It had been the focus, if not of real
	<a class="pagenum" id="page318" title="318"> </a>piety, at least of ostensible religion; and,
	dead as the spot now appeared, its
	mouldering walls, some of those gigantic
	trees, and, above all, the box-tree arbour,
	had, in remote ages, echoed from hour to
	hour the melodious chaunts and imposing
	ceremonials of the Romish Church. Here
	moral habits sanctified the routine of life,
	and conferred happiness as a necessary
	result of restraint and decorum—and here
	Vice never disgraced Reason by public exhibitions;
	but, if lurking in any breast,
	confessed its own deformity by its disguises
	and its secresy. In surveying such a spot,
	the hand of Time softens down even the
	asperities of superstition, and the shade
	of this gloomy site, contrasted with the
	bright days of its prosperity, inclined me
	to forget the intolerant policy which was
	wont to emanate from its spiritual councils.
	Under those fruit-trees, I exclaimed,
	lie all that remains of the follies, hopes,
	and superstitions of the former occupants;
	for, of them, I cannot remark as of the
	torpid remains in Mortlake church-yard,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page319" title="319"> </a>that they live in the present generation.—No!
	these dupes of clerical fraud devoted
	themselves to celibacy as a service to the
	procreative <em class="special_name">Cause</em> of <strong class="special_emphasis">CAUSES</strong>, and became
	withered limbs of their family trees.
	We can, however, now look on their remains,
	and presume to scan their errors:—but
	let us recollect, that, though we are
	gazers to-day, we shall be gazed upon to-morrow—and
	that, though we think ourselves
	wise, we are, perhaps, fated to be
	commiserated in our turn by the age which
	follows. Alas! said I, when will the generation
	arrive that will not merit as much
	pity from succeeding generations as those
	poor monks? Yet how wise, how infallible,
	and how intolerant, is every sect of
	religion—every school of philosophy—every
	party of temporary politicians—and every
	nation in regard to every other nation!
	Do not these objects, and all exertions of
	reasoning, prove, that the climax of human
	wisdom is <strong class="special_emphasis">HUMILITY</strong>?</p>

	<p>Commending the bones of the monks to
	the respect of the gardener, whose feelings,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page320" title="320"> </a>to do him justice, were in unison with my
	own, I proceeded, by the side of the wall,
	towards the banks of the Thames.</p>

	<p>The relics of exploded priestcraft which
	I had just contemplated in the adjoining
	garden, led me into an amusing train of
	thought on the origin and progress of
	superstition. I felt that the various mythologies
	which the world has witnessed, grow
	out of mistakes in regard to the phenomena
	of <strong class="special_emphasis">SECONDARY CAUSES</strong>; all natural phenomena,
	accordingly as they were <em>fit</em> or
	<em>unfit</em> to the welfare or caprices of men,
	being ascribed, by the barbarous tribes
	who subsequently became illustrious nations,
	to the agency of <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em> spirits.
	However absurd might be the follies
	of these superstitions, they became ingrafted
	on Society, and were implanted in
	the opening minds of every successive generation.
	Of course, the age never arrived
	which did not inherit the greater part of
	the prejudices of the preceding age. Reason
	and philosophy might in due time
	illumine a few individuals; yet even these,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page321" title="321"> </a>influenced by early prejudices, and a prudent
	regard for their fortunes and personal
	safety, would rather support, or give a
	beneficial direction to, mythological superstitions,
	than venture to expose and oppose
	them. Hence it was that the Egyptians,
	Greeks, and Romans, continued <em>polytheists</em>
	through the most brilliant epochs of their
	history; and hence their philosophers, as
	<em class="special_name">Pythagoras</em>, <em class="special_name">Plato</em>, and others, gave
	to the whole the plausibility of system, by
	affecting to demonstrate that the <strong class="special_emphasis">FIRST
	CAUSE</strong> necessarily and proximately generates
	immortal gods! Hence too it is that
	philosophers have, in different past ages,
	undertaken to demonstrate the verity of all
	religions, and according to the religion of the
	government under which they lived, they
	have either supported Polytheism, Theism,
	Sabinism, Judaism, Popery, or Mahomedanism.
	The fate of <em class="special_name">Socrates</em> has never been
	forgotten by any philosopher who possessed
	the chief attribute of wisdom—<strong class="special_emphasis">PRUDENCE</strong>;
	and no benevolent man will
	ever seek to disturb a public faith which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page322" title="322"> </a>promotes public virtue, because the memorials
	of history prove that no discords
	have been so bloody as those which have
	been generated by attempts to change religious
	faith. This class of human errors can
	indeed be corrected only by establishing
	in civilized countries practical and unequivocal
	systems of toleration; because, in
	that case, truth and reason are sure, in
	due time, to establish themselves, while
	falsehood and fraud must sink into merited
	contempt.</p>

	<p>The fleeting, wild, and crude notions of
	savages, constituted therefore the <em>first
	stage</em> in the progress of mythological superstition.
	Their invisible agencies would
	however soon have forms conferred upon
	them by weak or fertile imaginations, and
	be personified as men or animals, according
	to the nature of their deeds. To pray to
	them for benefits, and to deprecate their
	wrath, would constitute the <em>second stage</em>.
	In the mean time, individuals who might, by
	chance or design, become connected with
	some of these supernatural agencies, would
	<a class="pagenum" id="page323" title="323"> </a>be led, by vivid or gloomy imaginations,
	to deceive even themselves by notions of
	<em>election</em> or <em>inspiration</em>; and, then superadding
	ceremonials to worship, they would
	form a select class, living, without manual
	labour, on the tributes offered by the people
	to satisfy or appease the unseen agencies.
	This would constitute a <em>third stage</em>.
	Each priest would then endeavour to extol
	the importance of the god, of whom he
	believed himself to be the minister; and
	he would give to his deity a visible form,
	cause a temple to be built for him, deliver
	from it his oracles or prophecies, and affect
	to work miracles in his name. This would
	constitute the <em>fourth stage</em>. The terror
	of unseen powers would now be found to
	be a convenient engine of usurped human
	authority, and hence an association would
	be formed between the temporal and invisible
	powers, the latter being exalted by
	the former in having its temples enlarged
	and its priests better provided for. This
	would constitute the <em>fifth stage</em>; or the
	consummation of the system as it has
	<a class="pagenum" id="page324" title="324"> </a>been witnessed in India, Persia, Egypt,
	Greece, and Italy.—Hence among the
	<em class="special_name">Hindoos</em>, those personified agencies have
	been systematized under the titles of Brahma,
	Vishnu, Siva, Crishna, &amp;c. Among
	the <em class="special_name">Egyptians</em>, they were worshipped
	in the forms of living animals, and called
	Osiris, Ammon, Oris, Typhon, Isis, &amp;c.
	Among the <em class="special_name">Chaldeans</em>, and, after them,
	among the <em class="special_name">Jews</em>, they were classed in
	principalities, powers, and dominions of
	<em>angels</em> and <em>devils</em>, under chiefs, who bore
	the names of Raphael, Gabriel, Michael,
	Moloch, Legion, Satan, Beelzebub, &amp;c.
	Among the <em class="special_name">Greeks</em>, the accommodating
	Plato flattered the priests and the vulgar, by
	pretending to demonstrate that their personifications
	were necessary emanations
	from <strong class="special_emphasis">THE ONE</strong>; and he, and others,
	arranged the worship of them under the
	names of Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, Venus,
	Pluto, Mars, &amp;c. Among the <strong class="special_emphasis">NORTHERN
	NATIONS</strong>, they assumed the
	names of Woden, Sleepner, Hela, Fola,
	&amp;c. Every town and village had, moreover,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page325" title="325"> </a>its protecting divinity, or guardian
	saint, under some fantastical name, or the
	name of some fantastical fanatic; and,
	even every man, every house, every plant,
	every brook, every day, and every hour,
	according to most of those systems, had
	their accompanying genius! In a word,
	the remains of these superstitions are still
	so mixed with our habits and language,
	that, although we pity the hundreds of
	wretched victims of <em>legal wisdom</em>, who
	under Elizabeth and the Stuarts were
	burnt to death for witchcraft; and abhor
	the ghosts of Shakespeare, his fairies, and
	his enchantments; yet we still countenance
	the system in most of the personifications
	of language, and practise it when we
	speak even of the <em>spirit</em> of Philosophy
	and the <em>genius</em> of Truth.</p>

	<p>Nor have philosophers themselves, either
	in their independent systems, or in the
	systems of the schools, steered clear of the
	vulgar errors of mythologists. They have
	in every age introduced into nature active
	causes without contact, continuity, or proximity;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page326" title="326"> </a>and, even in our days, continue to
	extort worship towards the <em>unseen and
	occult</em> powers of attraction or sympathy,
	and of repulsion or antipathy! It is true,
	they say that such words only express <em>results</em>
	or <em>phenomena</em>, and others equivocate
	by saying there is in no case any contact:—but
	I reply, that to give names to proximate
	causes does not correspond with
	my notions of the proper business of philosophy;
	and that, in thousands of instances,
	there is sensible contact, and in
	all nature some contact of intermediate
	media, in the affections of which, may
	be traced the laws governing the phenomena
	of distant bodies. At the hour in
	which I write, the recognized philosophical
	divinities are called <em class="special_name">Space</em>, <em class="special_name">Matter</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Inertia</em>, <em class="special_name">Caloric</em>, <em class="special_name">Expansion</em>, <em class="special_name">Motion</em>,

	<em class="special_name">Electricity</em>, <em class="special_name">Light</em>, <em class="special_name">Excitability</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Irritability</em>, &amp;c. All these have
	<a class="pagenum" id="page327" title="327"> </a>their priests, worshippers, propagandists,
	and votaries, among some of whom may
	be found as intolerant a spirit of bigotry
	as ever disgraced any falling church. As
	governments do not, however, ally themselves
	to Philosophy, there is happily no
	danger that an heretical or reforming
	Philosopher will, as such, ever incur the
	hazard of martyrdom; and, as reason decides
	all disputes in the court of Philosophy,
	there can be no doubt, but, in this
	court at least, <em class="special_name">Truth</em> will finally prevail.</p>

	<p>Hail, Genius of Philosophy! Hail, thou
	poetical personification of wisdom! Hail,
	thou logical abstraction of all experimental
	knowledge! I hail thee, as thou art represented
	in the geniuses of Pythagoras,
	Thales, Aristotle, Archimedes, Ptolemy,
	Columbus, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes,
	Newton, Boyle, Euler, Buffon, Franklin,
	Beccaria, Priestley, Lavoisier, Cavendish,

	I hail thee, as thou excitest the ambition
	<a class="pagenum" id="page328" title="328"> </a>of the solitary student of an obscure village,
	to raise himself among those gods of
	the human race! How many privations
	must thy votaries suffer in a sordid world;
	and how many human passions must they
	subdue, before they can penetrate thy
	mazy walks, or approach the hidden sanctuaries
	of thy temple of Truth! Little
	thinks the babbling politician, the pedantic
	linguist, or the equivocating metaphysician,
	of the watchful hours which thy worshippers
	must pass,—of the never-ending
	patience which they must exert,—of the
	concurring circumstances which must favour
	their enthusiasm! Whether we consider

	the ascending intricacy of the books, the
	multitude of the instruments, or the variety
	of the experimental apparatus in the use
	of which the searchers into thy mysteries
	must be familiar; we are compelled to reverence
	the courage of him who seeks preeminence
	through thee, and to yield to
	those mortals who have attained thy favours,

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page330" title="330"> </a>Overtaking three or four indigent children,
	whose darned stockings and carefully-patched
	clothes bespoke some strong motive
	<a class="pagenum" id="page331" title="331"> </a>for attention in their parents, I was
	induced to ask them some questions. They
	said they had been to Mortlake School;
	and I collected from them, that they were
	part of two or three hundred who attend
	<a class="pagenum" id="page332" title="332"> </a>one of Dr. Bell’s schools, which had lately
	been established for the instruction of poor
	children in this vicinity. I found that,
	until this establishment had been formed,
	these children attended no school regularly—and,
	in reply to a question, one of them
	said, “Our father could not afford to pay
	Mr. —— sixpence a week for us, so we
	could not go at all; but now we go to this
	school, and it costs father nothing.” This
	was as it should be; the social state ought
	to supply a preparatory education of its
	members—or, how can a government expect
	to find moral agents in an ignorant
	population—how can it presume to inflict
	punishments on those who have not been
	enabled to read the laws which they are
	bound to respect—and how can the
	professors of religion consider themselves
	as performing their duty, if they have
	not enabled all children to peruse the
	volume of Christian Revelation? We are
	assured by Mr. Lancaster, that <em class="special_name">George
	the Third</em> expressed the benevolent
	wish that every one of his subjects should
	be enabled to read the Bible; and his successors
	<a class="pagenum" id="page333" title="333"> </a>will, it is to be hoped, not lose
	sight of so admirable a principle. But a
	few ages ago, to be able to read conferred
	the privileges of the clerical character, and
	exempted men from capital punishments—how
	improved, therefore, is the present
	state of society, and how different may it
	yet become, as prejudices are dispelled,
	and as liberal feelings acquire their just
	ascendancy among the rulers of nations!
	These boys spoke of their school with evident
	satisfaction; and one of them, who
	proved to be a monitor, seemed not a little
	proud of the distinction. Whether the
	system of Mr. Lancaster or of Dr. Bell
	enjoy the local ascendancy; or whether
	these public seminaries be “schools for
	all,” or schools in which the dogmas of
	some particular faith are taught, I am
	indifferent, provided there are some such
	schools, and that all children are enabled
	to read the Bible, and “<em>the Catechism of
	their Social Rights and Duties</em>.”</p>

	<p>Seeing several respectable houses facing
	the meadow which led to the Thames, I
	inquired of a passing female the names of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page334" title="334"> </a>their owners, and learnt that they were
	chiefly occupied by widow ladies, to whom
	she gave the emphatic title of <em>Madam</em>—though
	she called one of them <em>Mistress</em>.
	It appeared that those who were denominated
	<em>Madams</em> were widows of gentlemen
	who, in their lives, bore the title of
	<em>Esquires</em>; but that the <em>Mistress</em> was an
	old maid, whom her neighbours were
	ashamed longer to call by the juvenile
	appellation of <em>Miss</em>. <em>Madam ——</em>, whose
	name I ought not to have forgotten, has
	devoted a paddock of four or five acres to
	the comfortable provision of two super-annuated
	coach-horses. One of them, I
	was assured, was thirty-five years old, and
	the other nearly thirty; and their venerable
	appearance and pleasant pasture excited a
	strong interest in favour of their kind-hearted
	mistress. Such is the influence
	of good example, that I found her paddock
	was opposite the residence of the equally
	amiable <em class="special_name">Valentine Morris</em>, who so
	liberally provided for all his live-stock
	about thirty years ago, and whose oldest
	<a class="pagenum" id="page335" title="335"> </a>horse died lately, after enjoying his master’s
	legacy above twenty-four years.</p>

	<p>I now descended towards a rude space
	near the Thames, which appeared to be in
	the state in which the occasional overflowings
	and gradual retrocession of the river
	had left it. It was one of those wastes
	which the lord of the manor had not yet
	enabled some industrious cultivator to disguise;
	and in large tracts of which Great
	Britain still exhibits the surface of the
	earth in the pristine state in which it was
	left by the secondary causes that have
	given it form. The Thames, doubtless, in a
	remote age, covered the entire site; but
	it is the tendency of rivers to narrow
	themselves, by promoting prolific vegetable
	creations on their consequently increasing
	and encroaching banks, though the various
	degrees of fall produce every variety
	of currents, and consequently every variety
	of banks, in their devious course. In due
	time, the course of the river becomes
	choaked where a flat succeeds a rapid, and
	the detained waters then form lakes in the
	interior. These lakes likewise generate
	<a class="pagenum" id="page336" title="336"> </a>encroaching banks, which finally fill up
	their basins, when new rivers are formed
	on higher levels. These, in their turn,
	become interrupted, and repetitions of the
	former circle of causes produce one class
	of those elevations of land above the level
	of the sea, which have so much puzzled
	geologists. The only condition which a
	surface of dry land requires to increase
	and raise itself, is the absence of salt water,
	consequent on which is an accumulation
	of vegetable and animal remains.
	The Thames has not latterly been allowed
	to produce its natural effects, because for
	two thousand years the banks have been
	inhabited by man, who, unable to appreciate
	the general laws by which the phenomena
	of the earth are produced, has
	sedulously kept open the course of the
	river, and prevented the formation of
	interior lakes. The Caspian Sea, and all
	similar inland seas and lakes, were, for the
	most part, formed from the choaking up
	of rivers, which once constituted their outlets.
	If the course of nature be not interrupted
	by the misdirected industry of man,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page337" title="337"> </a>the gradual desiccation of all such collections
	of water will, in due time, produce
	land of higher levels on their sites. In
	like manner, the great lakes of North
	America, if the St. Lawrence be not sedulously
	kept open, will, in the course of
	ages, be filled up by the gradual encroachment
	of their banks, and the raising of
	their bottoms with strata of vegetable and
	animal remains. New rivers would then
	flow over these increased elevations, and
	the ultimate effect would be to raise that
	part of the continent of North America
	several hundred feet above its present
	level. Even the very place on which I
	stand was, according to <em class="special_name">Webster</em>, once
	a vast basin, extending from the Nore to
	near Reading, but now filled up with vegetable
	and animal remains; and the illustrious
	<em class="special_name">Cuvier</em> has discovered a similar
	basin round the site of Paris. These
	once were Caspians, created by the choaking
	and final disappearance of some mighty
	rivers—they have been filled up by gradual
	encroachments, and now the Thames
	<a class="pagenum" id="page338" title="338"> </a>and the Seine flow over them;—but these,
	if left to themselves, will, in their turn,
	generate new lakes or basins—and the
	successive recurrence of a similar series
	of causes will continue to produce similar
	effects, till interrupted by <em>superior</em> causes.</p>

	<p>This situation was so sequestered, and
	therefore so favourable to contemplation,
	that I could not avoid indulging myself.
	What then are those superior causes, I
	exclaimed, which will interrupt this series
	of natural operations to which man is
	indebted for the enchanting visions of hill
	and dale, and for the elysium of beauty
	and plenty in which he finds himself?
	Alas! facts prove, however, that all things
	are transitory, and that change of condition
	is the constant and necessary result of that
	motion which is the chief instrument of
	eternal causation, but which, in causing
	all phenomena, wears out existing organizations
	while it is generating new ones.
	In the motions of the earth as a planet,
	doubtless are to be discovered the superior
	causes which convert seas into continents,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page339" title="339"> </a>and continents into seas. These
	sublime changes are occasioned by the
	progress of the perihelion point of the
	earth’s orbit through the ecliptic, which
	passes from extreme northern to extreme
	southern declination, and <em>vice versa</em>, every
	10,450 years; and the maxima of the
	central forces in the perihelion occasion
	the waters to accumulate alternatively
	upon either hemisphere. During 10,450
	years, the sea is therefore gradually retiring
	and encroaching in both hemispheres:—hence
	all the varieties of marine
	appearances and accumulations of
	marine remains in particular situations;
	and hence the succession of layers or
	strata, one upon another, of marine and
	earthy remains. It is evident, from observation
	of those strata, that the periodical
	changes have occurred at least three times;
	or, in other words, it appears that the
	site on which I now stand has been three
	times covered by the ocean, and three
	times has afforded an asylum for vegetables
	and animals! How sublime—how
	<a class="pagenum" id="page340" title="340"> </a>interesting—how affecting is such a contemplation!
	How transitory, therefore,
	must be the local arrangements of man, and
	how puerile the study of the science miscalled
	Antiquities! How foolish the pride
	which vaunts itself on splendid buildings
	and costly mausoleums! How vain the
	ostentation of large estates, of extensive
	boundaries, and of great empires!—All—all—will,
	in due time, be swept away and
	effaced by the unsparing ocean; and, if
	recorded in the frail memorials of human
	science, will be spoken of like the lost
	Atalantis, and remembered only as a philosophical
	dream!</p>

	<p>Yet, how different, thought I, is the
	rich scene of organized existence within
	my view, from that which presented itself
	on this spot when our planet first took
	its station in the solar system. The surface,
	judging from its present materials,
	was then probably of the same inorganic
	form and structure as the primitive rocks
	which still compose the Alps and Andes;
	or like those indurated coral islands,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page341" title="341"> </a>which are daily raising their sterile heads
	above the level of the great ocean, and
	teaching by analogy the process of fertilization.
	At that period, so remote and so
	obscure, all must have been silent, barren,
	and relatively motionless! But, the atmosphere
	and the rains having, by decomposition
	and solution, pulverized the rocks,
	and reduced them into the various earths
	which now fertilize the surface, from the
	inorganic soon sprung the vegetable, and
	from the vegetable, in due time, sprung
	the animal; till the whole was resolved
	into the interesting assemblage of organized
	existences, which now present themselves
	to our endless wonder and gratification.</p>

	<p>I looked around me on this book of nature,
	which so eloquently speaks all languages,
	and which, for every useful purpose,
	may be read without translation or commentary,
	by the learned and unlearned in
	every age and clime. But my imagination
	was humbled on considering my relative
	and limited powers, when I desired to
	proceed from phenomena to causes, and to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page342" title="342"> </a>penetrate the secrets of nature below the
	surfaces of things. I desire, said I, to
	know more than my intellectual vision
	enables me to see in this volume of unerring
	truth. I can discover but the mere
	surfaces of things by the accidents of
	light. I can feel but the same surfaces in
	the contact of my body, and my conclusions
	are governed by their reciprocal
	relations. In like manner, I can hear,
	taste, and smell, only through the accidents
	of other media, all distinct from the
	nature of the substances which produce
	those accidents. In truth, I am the mere
	patient of certain illusions of my senses,
	and I can know nothing beyond what I
	derive from my capacity of receiving impressions
	from those illusions! Alas!
	thought I, I am sensible how little I know;
	yet how much is there which I do not,
	and can never, know? How much more
	am I incapable of knowing, with my limited
	organs of sense, than I might know if
	their capacity or their number were enlarged?
	How can a being, then, of such
	<a class="pagenum" id="page343" title="343"> </a>limited powers presume to examine nature
	beyond the mere surface? How can he
	measure unseen powers, of which he has
	no perception, but in the phenomena
	visible to his senses? How can he reason
	on the causes of effects by means of implements
	which reach no deeper than the
	accidents produced by the surfaces of
	things on the media which affect his senses,
	and which come not into contact with the
	powers that produce the phenomena?
	Ultimate causation is, therefore, hidden
	for ever from man; and his knowledge can
	reach no deeper or higher than to register
	mechanical phenomena, and determine
	their mutual relations. But there is yet
	enough for man to learn, and to gratify
	the researches of his curiosity; for, bounded
	as are his powers, he has always found
	that <em>art is too long and life too short</em>.
	He may nevertheless feel that his mind, in
	a certain sense, is within a species of intellectual
	prison; but, like the terrestrial
	prison which confines his body to one planet,
	no man ever lived long enough to
	<a class="pagenum" id="page344" title="344"> </a>exhaust the variety of subjects presented
	to his contemplation and curiosity by the
	intellectual and natural world.</p>

	<p>We seem, however, said I, to be better
	qualified to investigate the external laws
	which govern <strong class="special_emphasis">INORGANIC MATTER</strong>,
	than the subtle and local powers which
	govern organized bodies. We appear (so
	to speak) to be capable of looking down
	upon mere matter as matter; but incapable,
	like the eye in viewing itself, of retiring
	to such a focal distance as to be
	able accurately to examine ourselves. It
	is not difficult to conceive that planetary
	bodies, and other masses of inorganic
	matter, may appear to act on each other
	by mutually intercepting the pressure of
	the elastic medium which fills space; and
	the pressure intercepted by each on the
	inner surface of the other, may, by the un-intercepted
	external pressure on each,
	produce the phenomena of mutual gravitation:
	nor is it improbable that the
	curvilinear and rotatory motions of such
	masses may be governed by the arrangement
	<a class="pagenum" id="page345" title="345"> </a>and mutual action of their fixed and
	their fluid parts; nor impracticable for the
	geometrician, when the phenomena are
	determined, to measure the mechanical
	relations of the powers that produce those
	phenomena; nor wonderful that a system
	of bodies so governed by general laws,
	should move and act in a dependent, consequent,
	and necessary harmony.</p>

	<p>Thus far the intellect of an organized
	being may reason safely on the mechanical
	relations of inorganic masses, because an
	unequal balance of forces produces their
	motions, and from combined motions result
	the phenomena; but, in the principle
	of organic life, and in the duration and
	final purpose of the powers of vegetables
	and animals, there are mysteries which
	baffle the penetration of limited observation
	and reason. I behold <strong class="special_emphasis">VEGETABLES</strong>
	with roots fixed in the ground, and through
	them raising fluids mechanically; but my
	understanding is overpowered with unsatisfied
	wonder, when I consider the
	animating principle of the meanest vegetable,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page346" title="346"> </a>which constitutes a selfish individuality,
	and enables it to give new qualities
	to those fluids by peculiar secretions, and
	to appropriate them to its own nourishment
	and growth. My ambition after
	wisdom is humbled in the dust, whenever
	I inquire how the first germ of every
	species came into existence; whenever I
	consider the details of the varied powers
	in the energizing agency which originates
	each successive germ; and the independent,
	but coincident, passive receptacle which
	nurtures those germs, and, correcting
	aberrations, secures the continuity of every
	species—both acting as joint secondary
	causes; and whenever I reflect on the
	growth, maturity, beauty, and variety, of
	the vegetable kingdom! On these several
	subjects, my mind renders the profoundest
	homage to the <strong class="special_emphasis">MYSTERIOUS POWER</strong>
	which created and continues such miracles;
	and, being unable to reason upon
	them from the analogy of other experience,
	I am forced to refer such sublime results
	to agency not mechanical; or, if in any
	<a class="pagenum" id="page347" title="347"> </a>sense mechanical, so arranged and so moved
	as to exceed my means of conception.</p>

	<p>Looking once more upon the volume of
	nature which lay before me, I behold a
	superior class of organized beings, each
	individual of which, constituting an independent
	microcosm, is qualified to move
	from place to place, by bodily adaptation
	and nervous sensibility. This kingdom of
	<strong class="special_emphasis">LOCO-MOTIVE BEINGS</strong> ascends, in gradations
	of power and intellect, from the hydatid
	to the sympathetic and benevolent philosopher;
	and rises in the scale of being as
	much above the organization of vegetables,
	as vegetables themselves are superior to
	the inorganic particles in which they flourish.
	That they may subsist while they
	move, their roots, instead of being fixed in
	the soil, are turned within a cavity, or receptacle,
	called the stomach, into which,
	appropriate soil, or aliment, is introduced
	by the industry of the creature; and, that
	their powers of loco-motion may be exerted
	with safety and advantage, they are provided
	with senses for smelling, tasting, feeling, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page348" title="348"> </a>seeing their food; and with a power of hearing
	dangers which they cannot see. They
	are, for the same purpose, enabled to profit
	by experience in powers of association, of
	reasoning by analogy, and of willing according
	to their judgments; and they are governed
	by an habitual desire to associate
	in species, accompanied by moral feelings,
	resulting from obligations of mutual deference
	and convenience. Here again,
	humanly speaking, we have a series of natural
	miracles—a permanent connexion
	between external objects and the sensations,
	reasoning, and conduct of the organized
	being. We trace the animal
	frame to two constituent parts—the one
	mechanical, the other sensitive; the mechanical
	consisting of bones, skin, stomach,
	blood-vessels, glands, and intestines, provided
	with muscles and sinews for voluntary
	motion; and the sensitive, consisting
	of nerves and brain, which direct the
	motions by the feelings of the organs of
	sense—the results of the union constituting
	creatures whose essence is perception,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page349" title="349"> </a>springing from a system of brain and
	nerves, which, being nourished by the
	energies of circulating fluids, moved by a
	contrivance of muscles, and strengthened
	by an apparatus of bones, produce all those
	varieties of feeling, durable, moving, and
	powerful beings, whose functions continue
	as long as the original expansive
	powers balance the unceasing inertia of
	their materials. But, of that <strong class="special_emphasis">SUBTLE
	PRINCIPLE</strong> which distinguishes <em>organic
	life</em> from <em>inert matter</em>—of that principle
	of individuality which generates the
	passion of self-love, and leads each individual
	to preserve and sustain its own existence—of
	that principle which gives peculiar
	powers of growth, and maturity, to
	germs of vegetables and animals—and of
	that principle which, being stopped, suspended,
	or destroyed, in the meanest or
	greatest of them, produces the awful difference
	between the living and the dead—we
	have no knowledge, and we seem
	incapable of acquiring any, by the limited
	powers of our senses. Whether this principle
	of vitality is a principle of its own
	<a class="pagenum" id="page350" title="350"> </a>kind, imparted from parent plants and
	animals to their germs; or whether it
	is the result of the totality of the being,
	like the centre of a sphere,—are questions
	which must perhaps for ever remain undetermined
	by the reasoning powers of
	man.</p>

	<p>The creature of an hour, whose chief
	care it is to live and indulge his self-love,
	who cannot see without light, nor distinctly
	above a few inches from the eye, is wholly
	incompetent to determine those questions
	which have so long agitated philosophy;
	as, Whether the phenomena of the creation
	could be made to exist without action
	and re-action, and without space?—Whether,
	consequently, there are <strong class="special_emphasis">THREE</strong> Eternals,
	or <strong class="special_emphasis">ONE</strong> Eternal?—Whether the
	<strong class="special_emphasis">SUPREME INTELLIGENCE</strong>, <strong class="special_emphasis">MATTER</strong>
	void of form, and <strong class="special_emphasis">SPACE</strong> containing it,
	were all eternal—or whether the supreme
	intelligence alone was eternal, and matter
	and space created?—Whether the supreme
	intelligence has only been exerted proximately
	or remotely on inorganic matter;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page351" title="351"> </a>space being the necessary medium of creation,
	and organization being the result?—Whether
	the globe of the earth, in form,
	is eternal, or, according to Herschel, the
	effect of “a clustering power” in the matter
	of space, beginning and ending, according
	to the general analogy of organized
	beings?—Whether the earth was a comet,
	the ellipticality of whose orbit has been reduced;
	and, if so, what was the origin of
	the comet?—How the secondary mountains
	were liquefied—whether by fire or
	by water—and what were the then relations
	of the earth to the sun?—How and
	when that liquefaction ceased; and how,
	and when, and in what order of time, the
	several organizations arose upon them?—How
	those organizations, at least those
	now existing, received the powers of secondary
	causes for continuing their kind?—How
	every species now lives, and grows,
	and maintains an eternal succession of
	personal identities?—How these things
	were before we were, and how they now
	are on every side of us—are topics which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page352" title="352"> </a>have made so much learning ridiculous,
	that, if I were to discuss them, in the best
	forms prescribed by the schools, I might
	but imitate in folly the crawling myriads,
	who luxuriate for an hour on a ripening
	peach; and who, like ourselves, may be
	led by their vanity to discuss questions in
	regard to the eternity, and other attributes,
	of the prodigious globe, which they have
	inherited from their remote ancestry, and
	of which the early history is lost in the
	obscure traditions of their countless generations!</p>

	<p>Without presuming, however, to argue
	on premises which finite creatures cannot
	justly estimate, we may safely infer, in regard
	to the world in which we are placed,
	that all things which <strong class="special_emphasis">DO EXIST</strong>, owe their
	existence to their <strong class="special_emphasis">COMPATIBILITY</strong> with
	other existences; to the necessary <strong class="special_emphasis">FITNESS</strong>
	of all existing things; and to the
	<strong class="special_emphasis">HARMONY</strong> which is essential to the existence
	of any thing in the form and mode
	in which it does exist: for, without reciprocal
	<strong class="special_emphasis">COMPATIBILITY</strong>, without individual
	<a class="pagenum" id="page353" title="353"> </a><strong class="special_emphasis">FITNESS</strong>, and without universal
	<strong class="special_emphasis">HARMONY</strong>, nothing could <strong class="special_emphasis">CONTINUE
	TO EXIST</strong> which <strong class="special_emphasis">DOES EXIST</strong>; and,
	therefore, what does exist, is for the time
	<strong class="special_emphasis">NECESSARILY COMPATIBLE</strong> with other
	existences, <strong class="special_emphasis">FIT</strong> or <strong class="special_emphasis">NOT INCOMPATIBLE</strong>,
	and in <strong class="special_emphasis">HARMONY</strong> with the whole of <strong class="special_emphasis">CO-EXISTENT
	BEING</strong>. Every organized <strong class="special_emphasis">EXISTENCE</strong>
	affords, therefore, indubitable
	evidence of <strong class="special_emphasis">FINAL CAUSES</strong> or <strong class="special_emphasis">PURPOSES</strong>,
	competent to produce and sustain
	it; of certain relations of <strong class="special_emphasis">FITNESS</strong> to other
	beings; of <strong class="special_emphasis">COMPATIBILITY</strong> with other
	existences; and of <strong class="special_emphasis">HARMONY</strong> in regard
	to the whole. And every case of <strong class="special_emphasis">DESTRUCTION</strong>
	affords evidence, that certain
	<strong class="special_emphasis">FINAL CAUSES</strong> have become unequal
	to their usual office; that the being
	is <strong class="special_emphasis">UNFIT</strong> to exist simultaneously with
	some other beings; that its existence is
	<strong class="special_emphasis">INCOMPATIBLE</strong> with certain circumstances,
	or that it is contrary to the general
	<strong class="special_emphasis">HARMONY</strong> of co-existent being. May
	not the fifty thousand species of beings
	now discoverable, be all the species whose
	<a class="pagenum" id="page354" title="354"> </a>existences have continued to be fit, compatible,
	and harmonious? May not the
	known extinction of many species be received
	as evidence, therefore, of the gradual
	decay of the powers which sustain
	organized being on our planet? May not
	the extinction of one species render the
	existence of others more unfit, by diminishing
	the number of final causes? And, may
	not the successive breaking or wearing out
	of these links of final causes ultimately
	lead to the end of all organized being, or
	to what is commonly called, <strong class="special_emphasis">THE END OF
	OUR WORLD</strong>?</p>

	<p>As I approached a sequestered mansion-house,
	and some other buildings, which
	together bear the name of <em class="special_name">Brick-stables</em>,
	I crossed a corner of the meadow
	towards an angle formed by a rude
	inlet of the Thames, which was running
	smoothly towards the sea at the pace of
	four miles an hour. The tide unites here
	with the ordinary current, and, running a
	few miles above this place, exhibits twice
	a day the finely-reduced edge of that physical
	balance-wheel or oscillating fluid-pendulum
	<a class="pagenum" id="page355" title="355"> </a>which creates the earth’s centrifugal
	power, varies the centre of its
	forces, and holds in equilibrium that delicately
	adjusted pressure of the medium of
	space, which pressure, without such balance,
	would, by its <em>clustering power</em>,
	drive together the isolated masses of suns
	and planets.—In viewing the beautiful
	process of Nature, presented by a
	majestic river, we cease to wonder that
	priestcraft has often succeeded in teaching
	nations to consider rivers as of divine origin,
	and as living emblems of Omnipotence.
	Ignorance, whose constant error it is to
	look only to the last term of every series
	of causes, and which charges Impiety on
	all who venture to ascend one term higher,
	and Atheism on all who dare to explore
	several terms (though every series implies
	a first term), would easily be persuaded
	by a crafty priesthood to consider a beneficent
	river as a tangible branch of the
	Godhead. But we now know that the
	waters which flow down a river, are but a
	portion of the rains and snows which,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page356" title="356"> </a>having fallen near its source, are returning
	to the ocean, there to rise again and
	re-perform the same circle of vapours,
	clouds, rains, and rivers. What a process
	of fertilization, and how still more
	luxuriant would have been this vicinity, if
	man had not levelled the trees and carried
	away the crops of vegetation! What a
	place of shelter would thus have been
	afforded to tribes of amphibiæ, whose accumulated
	remains often surprise geologists,
	though necessarily consequent on
	the fall of crops of vegetation on each
	other, near undisturbed banks of rivers.
	Happily, in Britain, our coal-pits, or mineralized
	forests, have supplied the place
	of our living woods; or man, regardless of
	the fitness of all the parts to the perfection
	of every natural result, might here, as in
	other long-peopled countries, ignorantly
	have thwarted the course of Nature by
	cutting down the timber, which, acting on
	the electricity of the clouds, affects their
	density, and causes them to fall in fertilizing
	showers. Such has been the fate of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page357" title="357"> </a>all the countries famous in antiquity.
	Persia, Syria, Arabia, parts of Turkey,
	and the Barbary coast, have been rendered
	arid deserts by this inadvertency. The
	clouds from the Western Ocean would long
	since have passed over England without
	disturbance from the conducting powers
	of leaves of trees, or blades of grass, if our
	coal-works had not saved our natural conductors;
	while this Thames, the agent of
	so much abundance and so much wealth,
	might, in that case, have become a shallow
	brook, like the once equally famed Jordan,
	Granicus, or Ilyssus.</p>

	<p>The dingy atmosphere of London
	smoke, which I had measured so accurately
	on Putney Heath, presented itself
	again over the woods of Chiswick Grove,
	reminding me of the cares of the busy
	world, and producing a painful contrast to
	the tranquillity of nature, to the silently
	gliding Thames, and to the unimpassioned
	simplicity of the vegetable creation. <em class="special_name">Man</em>,
	I reflected, brings upon himself a thousand
	calamities as consequences of his artifices
	<a class="pagenum" id="page358" title="358"> </a>and pride, and then, overlooking his own

	every natural pleasure, to acquire fame
	among transient beings, who forget him
	nightly in sleep, and eternally in death;
	and seeks to render his name celebrated
	among posterity, though it has no identity
	with his person, and though posterity and
	himself can have no contemporaneous feeling—<strong class="special_emphasis">HE</strong>
	deprives himself, and all around
	him, of every passing enjoyment, to accumulate

	make effective laws to protect the poor

	his own neglect and injustice—<strong class="special_emphasis">HE</strong> arms
	himself with murderous weapons, and on
	the lightest instigations practises murder as

	his caprices, or his gluttonies; while, more
	unhappy than his victims, he is constantly
	arraigning that system in which he is the
	chief cause of more misery than all other

	to live and let live, is a maxim of universal
	justice, extending not only to all man’s

	<p>I was thus employed in drawing a species
	of Indictment against the errors, follies,
	selfishness, and vices of my fellow-men,
	while I passed along a pleasant foot-path,
	which conducted me from Brick-stables to
	the carriage-road from Mortlake to Kew.
	On arriving at the stile, I saw a colony of
	the people called <em class="special_name">Gipsies</em>, and, gratified
	at falling in with them, I seated myself
	upon it, and, hailing the eldest of the men
	in terms of civility, he approached me
	courteously; and I promised myself, from
	the interview, a fund of information relative
	to the economy of those people.</p>

	<p>Policy so singular, manners so different,
	and passions so varied, have for so many
	ages characterized the race of Gipsies,
	that the incident of meeting with one of
	their little camps agreeably roused me
	<a class="pagenum" id="page364" title="364"> </a>from that reverie on Matter and its modifications,
	into which I had fallen. What
	can be more strongly marked than the
	gipsy physiognomy? Their lively jet-black
	eyes—their small features—their tawny
	skins—their small bones—and their shrill
	voices, bespeak them to be a distinct tribe
	of the human race, as different from the
	English nation as the Chinese, the North-American
	Indians, or the woolly-headed
	Africans. They seem, in truth, as different
	in their bodies, and in their instincts,
	from the inhabitants of England and other
	countries in which they live, as the spaniel
	from the greyhound, or as the cart-horse
	from the Arabian. Our instincts, propensities,
	or fit and necessary habits, seem to
	lead us, like the ant, to lay up stores;
	theirs, like the grasshopper, to depend on
	the daily bounties of nature;—we, with
	the habits of the beaver, build fixed habitations;
	and they, like the deer, range
	from pasture to pasture;—we, with an
	instinct all our own, cultivate arts; they
	content themselves with picking up our
	<a class="pagenum" id="page365" title="365"> </a>superfluities;—we make laws and arrange
	governments; they know no laws but those
	of personal convenience, and no government
	beyond that of muscular force growing
	out of the habits of seniority;—and we
	cherish passions of ambition and domination,
	consequent on our other arrangements,
	to which they are utter strangers.
	Thus, we indulge our propensities, and
	they indulge theirs. Which are the happiest
	beings, might be made a question—but
	I am led to decide in favour of the
	arts and comforts of civilized life. These
	people appear to possess the natural feebleness
	and delicacy of man, without the
	power of shielding themselves from the
	accidents of nature. Their darling object
	appears to be, to enjoy practical personal
	liberty. They possess less, and they enjoy
	fewer, luxuries than others; but they
	escape slavery in all the Protean shapes
	by which it ensnares the rest of mankind.
	They do not act as menial servants, and
	obey the caprice of a master; nor do they
	work as labourers for a tythe of the advantages
	<a class="pagenum" id="page366" title="366"> </a>of their industry. They do not, as
	tenants of land, pay half the produce in
	rentals; nor do they, as anxious traders, pay
	half their profits to usurers or capitalists.
	They are not liable to the conscriptions of
	a militia-ballot; nor to be dragged from
	their families by the frightful tyranny of
	the impress. And, in fine, they are not
	compelled to contribute a large portion of
	their earnings in taxes to support folly
	or prodigality; nor are they condemned
	to pay, through their successive generations,
	the interest of money lent for the hire
	of destroyers of men, who were, like themselves,
	guilty only of resolving to be free.
	Yet, if they are exempt from the torture
	of civilized man, of having the comforts he
	enjoys torn from him by the sophistry of
	law, or the tyranny of governments; they
	suffer from hour to hour the torments of
	want, and the apprehension of not meeting
	with renewed supplies. If they are
	gayer than civilized man, it is because
	their wants are fewer, and therefore fewer
	of them are unsatisfied; and probably the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page367" title="367"> </a>gaiety which they assume before strangers
	may result from their constitution, which,
	under the same circumstances, may render
	them gayer than others, just as a Frenchman
	is gayer than an Englishman, or an
	Englishman than a North-American Indian.
	In a word, in looking upon this race,
	and upon the other recorded varieties of
	our species, from the woolly-headed African
	to the long-haired Asiatic, from the
	blue-eyed and white-haired Goth to the
	black-eyed and black-haired North American,
	and from the gigantic Patagonian
	to the dwarfish Laplander; we are led to
	believe, that the human species must radically
	have been as various as any other
	species of animated beings; and it seems
	as unphilosophical as impious, to limit the
	powers of creation to pairs of one kind,
	and to ascribe their actual varieties to the
	operations of chance.</p>

	<p>As I proceeded from the stile towards
	their tents, the apparent chief of the gang
	advanced with a firm step, holding a large
	knife in one hand, and some eatables in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page368" title="368"> </a>the other; and he made many flourishes
	with his knife, seemingly in the hope of
	intimidating me, if I proved an enemy. I
	civilly begged his pardon for intruding
	upon their camp, and assured him that
	mine was a mere visit of curiosity; that I
	was not a justice of the peace, and had no
	desire to disturb them. He then told me
	I was very welcome, and I advanced to
	their chief tent. “But,” said I to this
	man, “you have not the gipsy colour and
	features?” “O, no,” he replied, “I am
	no gipsy—the people call us all <em>gipsies</em>—but
	I am by trade a tinker—I live in —— Court,
	Shoreditch, in the winter; and
	during the summer I travel the country,
	and get my livelihood by my trade.”
	Looking at others of the group, who were
	sitting at the entrance of two tents, I
	traced two sets of features among them, one
	plainly English, and the other evidently
	Gipsy; and, mentioning this circumstance,
	he replied, “O yes—though I am not
	a gipsy, my wife is, and so is her old mother
	there—they are true gipsies, every
	<a class="pagenum" id="page369" title="369"> </a>inch of ’em. This man, my wife’s brother,
	is a gipsy—we are useful to one another
	in this way of life—and the old woman
	there is as knowing a gipsy as any in the
	country, and can tell your fortune, sir, if
	you like to hear it.”—His character of the
	elder gipsy, who resembled Munden’s
	witch in Macbeth, produced considerable
	mirth in the whole party; and the old woman,
	who was engaged in smoking her pipe,
	took it from her mouth, and said: “I ayn’t
	told so many gentlefolks their fortunes to
	no purpose, and I’ll tell your’s, sir, if
	you’ll give me something to fill my pipe.”
	I smiled, and told her I thanked her; but,
	as I was not <em>in love</em>, I felt no anxiety to
	hear my fortune.—“Aye, sir,” said she,
	“many’s the lover I’ve made happy, and
	many’s the couple that I’ve brought together.”—Recollecting
	Farquhar’s incident
	in the Recruiting Officer, I remarked:—“You
	tell the ladies what their lovers
	hire you to tell them, I suppose—and the
	gentlemen what the ladies request you to
	tell them?”—“Why, yes,” said she,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page370" title="370"> </a>“something like it;” and laughing—“aye,
	sir, I see you’re in the secret!”—“And
	then you touch golden fees, I suppose?”—“Yes,”
	interrupted the first man, “I’ve
	known her get five or six guineas on a
	wedding-day, part from the lady, and part
	from the gentleman; and she never wants
	a shilling, and a meal’s victuals, when she
	passes many houses that I could name.”—“True,”
	exclaimed the old beldame, “that’s
	all true; and I’ve made many fine folks
	happy in my time, and so did my mother
	before me—she was known far and near!”
	I had no occasion to remark on the silly
	dupes on whom they practised these impositions,
	for the whole party expressed their
	sentiments by bursts of laughter while the
	old woman was speaking: but I could not
	help exclaiming, that I thought she ought
	to make the fools pay well who gave credit
	to her prophecies.—“Aye,” said she,
	“I see you don’t believe in our art—but
	we tell all by <em>the hand</em>!”—I felt of course
	that <em>the hand</em> was as good a key to determine
	the order of <em>probable</em> events as planets,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page371" title="371"> </a>cards, or tea-sediments; and therefore,
	concluding that gipsies, like astrologers
	and other prophets, are imposed on
	by the doctrine of chances, I dropped the
	conversation; but felt it my duty to give
	the old woman a shilling to buy some
	tobacco for her pipe.</p>

	<p>I now surveyed the entire party, and in
	three tents found there were three men,
	two women, besides the old woman, four
	girls, and two boys. One of the tents was
	placed at a little distance from the others,
	and in that resided a young married couple.—“And
	pray,” said I, “where and
	how do you marry?”—“Why,” said the
	first man, “we marry like other folks—they
	were married at Shoreditch Church—I
	was married to my old woman here at
	Hammersmith Church—and my brother-in-law
	here was married at Acton Church.”—“Then,”
	said I, “you call yourselves
	Christians?”—At this question they all
	laughed; and the first man said, that, “If
	it depends on our going to church, we
	can’t say much about it; but, as we do
	<a class="pagenum" id="page372" title="372"> </a>nobody any harm, and work for our living,
	some in one way, and some in another, we
	suppose we are as good Christians as many
	other folks.”</p>

	<p>While this conversation passed, I heard
	them speaking to each other in a language
	somewhat resembling Irish, but it had
	tones more shrill; and the first man, notwithstanding
	his English physiognomy, as
	well as the others, spoke with a foreign
	accent, not unlike that of half-anglicized
	Hindoos. I mentioned this peculiarity;
	but he assured me that neither he nor any
	of the party had been out of England. I
	now inquired about their own language,
	when one of them said it was <em>Maltese</em>; but
	the other said it was their <em>cant</em> language.
	I asked their names for various objects
	which I pointed out; but, after half a dozen
	words, the first man inquired, if I had
	“ever heard of one Sir Joseph Banks—for,”
	said he, “that gentleman once paid
	me a guinea for telling him twenty words
	in our language.” Perceiving, therefore,
	that he rated this species of information
	<a class="pagenum" id="page373" title="373"> </a>very high, and aware that the subject has
	been treated at large by many authors, I
	forbore to press him further.</p>

	<p>The ground served them for a table, and
	the grass for a table-cloth. The mixture
	of their viands with dirty rags, and other
	disgusting objects, proved that they possess
	no sentiment, in regard to cleanliness,
	superior to lower animals. Like philosophical
	chemists, they evidently admitted the
	elementary analogy of what the delicate
	sense of society classes under contrasted
	heads of <em>dirty</em> and <em>clean</em>. Necessity, in
	this respect, has generated fixed habits;
	and they are, consequently, as great
	strangers to the refined feeling which actuates
	cleanly housewives, as lawyers are to a
	spirit of benevolence, or ministers of state
	to a passion for reform. Their furniture
	consisted merely of some dirty rags and
	blankets, and of two or three bags, baskets,
	and boxes; while their tents were formed of
	a pole at each end, with a ridge pole, covered
	with blanketing, which was stretched
	obliquely to the ground by wooden
	<a class="pagenum" id="page374" title="374"> </a>pegs. Such rudeness, and such simplicity,
	afforded a striking contrast to the gorgeous
	array of oriental splendour in the palaces of
	Royalty; and to the varied magnificence
	displayed in those warehouses whence an
	Oakley, or a Bullock, supplies the mansions
	of wealth and grandeur.</p>

	<p>Indeed, as I stood conversing with these
	people, how could I help marvelling that,
	in the most polished district of the most civilized
	of nations, with the grand pagoda of
	Kew-Gardens in full view on one hand, and
	the towers of the new Bastile Palace in sight
	on the other, I should thus have presented
	under my eyes a family of eleven persons
	in no better condition than the Hottentots
	in their kraals, the Americans in their wigwams,
	or the Tartars in their equally rude
	tents. I sighed, however, to think that
	difference of natural constitution and
	varied propensities were in England far
	from being the only causes of the proximity
	of squalid misery to ostentatious
	pomp. I felt too that the manners of
	these gipsies were assimilated to those of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page375" title="375"> </a>the shepherd tribes of the remotest antiquity,
	and that in truth I saw before me a
	family of the pastoral ages, as described in
	the Book of Genesis. They wanted their
	flocks and herds; but the possession of
	these neither accorded with their own policy,
	nor with that of the country in which
	they reside. Four dogs attached to their
	tents, and two asses grazing at a short distance,
	completed such a grouping as a
	painter would, I have no doubt, have
	found in the days of Abraham in every
	part of Western Asia, and as is now to be
	found among the same people, at this day,
	in every country in Europe. They exhibit
	that state of man in which thousands
	of years might pass away without record
	or improvement: and, whether they are
	Egyptians, Arabs, Hindoos, Tartars, or a
	peculiar variety of our species; whether
	they exhibit man in the rude state which,
	according to Lord Montboddo, most nearly
	approximates to the ourang-outang of the
	oriental forests; or whether they are considered
	in their separated character—they
	<a class="pagenum" id="page376" title="376"> </a>form an interesting study for the philosopher,
	the economist, and the antiquary.</p>

	<p>In a few minutes after I had left the
	gipsy camp, I was overtaken by a girl of
	fifteen, the quickness of whose breathing
	indicated excessive alarm. “O, sir,” said
	she, “I’m so glad to come up with you—I’m
	so frightened—I’ve been standing this
	quarter of an hour on the other side of
	the stile, waiting for somebody to come
	by.”—“And what has so frightened you?”
	said I.—“O, sir,” said the still terrified
	girl, looking behind her, and increasing
	her pace, “those gipsies and witches—they
	frighten every body; and I wo’dn’t have
	come this way for all the world if I’d
	known they’d been there.”—“But,” said
	I, “what are you frightened at? have you
	heard that they have done harm to any
	one?”—“O dear! yes, sir, I’ve heard my
	mother say they bewitches people; and,
	one summer, two of them beat my father
	dreadfully.”—“But what did he do to
	them?”—“Why, he was a little tipsy, to
	be sure; but he says he only called ’em a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page377" title="377"> </a>pack of fortune-tellers.”—“And are all
	the children in this neighbourhood as much
	frightened at them as you?”—“O yes, sir;
	but some of the boys throw stones over the
	hedge at them, but we girls are afraid
	they’ll bewitch us. Did you see the old
	hag, sir?” The poor girl asked this question
	with such simplicity, and with a faith
	so confirmed, that I had reason once more
	to feel astonishment at the superstition
	which infests and disgraces the common
	people of this generally enlightened nation!
	Let me hope that the tutors in the
	schools of Bell and Lancaster will consider
	it as part of their duties, to destroy the
	vulgar faith in ghosts, omens, fortune-telling,
	fatality, and witchcraft.</p>

	<p>On my right, my attention was attracted
	by the battlements of a new Gothic building,
	which I learnt, from the keeper of
	an adjoining turnpike, was called <em class="special_name">Kew
	Priory</em>, and is a summer retreat of
	a wealthy Catholic maiden lady, Miss
	Doughty, of Richmond-Hill; after whom
	a street has recently been named in London.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page378" title="378"> </a>Learning that the lady was not
	there, I turned aside to take a nearer
	view; and, ringing at the gate, in the hope
	of seeing the interior, a female, who
	opened it, told me that it was a rule of the
	place, that <em>no man</em> could be admitted besides
	the Rev. Mr. ——, the Catholic
	priest. I learnt that the Priory, a beautiful
	structure on a lawn, consisted merely of
	a chapel, a room for refreshments, and a
	library; and that the lady used it for a
	change of scene in the long afternoons of
	the summer season. The enclosed space
	contained about 24 acres, on the banks of
	the Thames, and is subdivided by Pilton’s
	invisible fences. Behind the priory, there
	is a house for the bailiff and his wife, a capacious
	pheasantry, an aviary, and extensive
	stables. Nothing can be more tasteful
	as a place of indulgence for the luxury
	of wealth; but it is exposed to the inconvenience
	of floods from the river, which
	sometimes cover the entire site to a considerable
	depth.</p>

	<p>Another quarter of a mile, along a dead
	<a class="pagenum" id="page379" title="379"> </a>flat, brought me upon <em class="special_name">Kew-Green</em>. As
	I approached it, the woods of Kew and
	Richmond Gardens presented a varied and
	magnificent foliage, and the pagoda of
	ten stories rose in splendour out of the
	woods. Richmond-hill bounded the horizon
	on the left, and the smoky atmosphere
	of Brentford obscured the air beyond the
	houses on Kew-Green.</p>

	<p>As I quitted the lane, I beheld, on my left,
	the long boundary-wall of Kew-Gardens;
	on which a disabled sailor has drawn in
	chalk the effigies of the whole British navy,
	and over each representation appears the
	name of the vessel, and the number of her
	guns. He has in this way depicted about
	800 vessels, each five or six feet long, and
	extending, with intervening distances, above
	a mile and a half. As the labour of one
	man, the whole is an extraordinary performance;
	and I was told the decrepit
	draughtsman derives a competency from
	passing travellers.</p>

	<p><em class="special_name">Kew-Green</em> is a triangular area of
	about thirty acres. Nearly in the centre
	<a class="pagenum" id="page380" title="380"> </a>is the chapel of St. Anne. On the eastern
	side is a row of family houses; on the
	north-western side a better row, the backs
	of which look to the Thames; and on the
	south side stand the boundary-wall of
	Kew-Gardens, some buildings for soldiery,
	and the plain house of Ernest, duke of
	Cumberland. Among other persons of
	note and interest who reside here, are
	the two respectable daughters of Stephen
	Duck, the poet, who deserve to be mentioned
	as relics of a former age. In the
	western corner stand the buildings called
	Kew Palace, in which George III. passed
	many of the early years of his reign, and
	near which he began a new structure a few
	years before his confirmed malady—which
	I call the <em>Bastile Palace</em>, from its resemblance
	to that building, so obnoxious to
	freedom and freemen. On a former occasion,
	I have viewed its interior, and I am
	at loss to conceive the motive for preferring
	an external form, which rendered
	it impracticable to construct within it more
	than a series of large closets, boudoirs,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page381" title="381"> </a>and rooms like oratories. The works
	have, however, been suspended since the
	unhappy seclusion of the Royal Architect;
	and it is improbable, at least in this generation,
	that they will be resumed. The
	foundation is in a bog close to the Thames,
	and the principal object within its view is
	the dirty town of Brentford, on the opposite
	side of the river.</p>

	<p>I had intended to prolong my route to
	the western corner of the Green; but, in
	passing St. Anne’s Chapel, I found the
	pew-openers engaged in wiping the pews
	and washing the aisles. I knew that that
	child of Genius, <em class="special_name">Gainsborough</em>, the
	painter, lay interred here; and, desirous
	of paying my homage to his grave, I inquired
	for the spot. As is usual in regard
	to this class of people, they could give me
	no information; yet one of them fancied
	she had heard such a name before. I
	was therefore obliged to wait while the
	sexton or clerk was fetched, and in the
	interim I walked into the chapel. I was,
	in truth, well re-paid for the time it cost
	<a class="pagenum" id="page382" title="382"> </a>me; for I never saw any thing prettier, except
	Lord Le Despencer’s exquisite structure
	at West Wycombe. As the royal
	family usually attend here when they reside
	at Kew, it is superbly fitted up, and
	the architecture is in the best taste. The
	seats for the family fill the gallery, and on
	the ground-floor there are forty-eight pews
	of brown oak, adapted for four and six
	persons each. Several marble monuments
	of singular beauty adorn the walls; but the
	record of a man of genius absorbed every
	attraction of ordinary rank and title. It
	was a marble slab, to the memory of
	<em class="special_name">Meyer</em>, the painter,—with lines by the
	amiable poet, <em class="special_name">Hayley</em>; and I was led,
	by respect for painter and poet, to copy
	the whole:—</p>

	<div class="epigraph">

		<div class="poem">
			<p>Meyer! in thy works, the world will ever see</p>

	<p class="continued_paragraph">From hence I strolled into the vestry,
	where I found a table of fees, drawn with
	a degree of precision which merits imitation.
	It appears, that the fees for <strong class="special_emphasis">MARRIAGES</strong>
	with a licence are 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and
	by banns 5<i>s.</i> That those for <strong class="special_emphasis">BURIALS</strong>,
	to the minister, if the prayers are said in
	the church, are 5<i>s.</i>; if only at the grave,
	2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The graves are six feet deep;
	and, in the church, the coffin must be of
	lead. The clerk is entitled to <i>half</i>, and
	the sexton to about a <i>third</i> more. A
	vault in the church is charged 21<i>l.</i>, and in
	the church-yard 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; with 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>
	and 2<i>l.</i>2<i>s.</i> respectively for each time of
	opening. To non-residents they are double.—I
	had scarcely finished this extract,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page384" title="384"> </a>when the clerk’s or sexton’s assistant made
	his appearance; and on the south side of
	the church-yard he brought me to the
	tomb of <em class="special_name">Gainsborough</em>.</p>

	<p>“Ah! friend,” said I, “this is a hallowed
	spot—here lies one of Britain’s
	favoured sons, whose genius has assisted in
	exalting her among the nations of the
	earth.”—“Perhaps it was so,” said the
	man, “but we know nothing about the
	people buried, except to keep up their monuments,
	if the family pay; and, perhaps,
	Sir, you belong to this family; if so, I’ll
	tell you how much is due.”—“Yes, truly,
	friend,” said I, “I am one of the great
	family bound to preserve the monument of
	Gainsborough; but, if you take me for
	one of his relatives, you are mistaken.”—“Perhaps,
	Sir, you may be of the family,
	but were not included in the Will, therefore
	are not obligated.” I could not now
	avoid looking with scorn at the fellow; but,
	as the spot claimed better feelings, I gave
	him a trifle for his trouble, and mildly told
	him I would not detain him.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page385" title="385"> </a>The monument being a plain one, and
	making no palpable appeal to vulgar admiration,
	was disregarded by these people;
	for it is in death as in life, if you would
	excite the notice of the multitude, you
	must in the grave have a splendid mausoleum,
	or in walking the streets you must
	wear fine clothes. It did not fall in the
	way of the untaught, on this otherwise
	polite spot, to know that they have among
	them the remains of <strong class="special_emphasis">THE FIRST PAINTER
	OF OUR NATIONAL SCHOOL</strong>, in fancy-pictures,
	and one <strong class="special_emphasis">OF THE FIRST</strong> in the
	classes of landscape and portrait;—a man
	who recommended himself as much by his
	superiority, as by his genius; as much by
	the mode in which his genius was developed,
	as by the perfection of his works;
	and as much by his amiable private character
	as by his eminence in the chief of Fancy’s
	Arts. There is this difference between a
	poet and a painter—that the poet only exhibits
	the types of ideas in words, limited
	in their sense by his views, or his powers
	of expression; but the painter is called
	<a class="pagenum" id="page386" title="386"> </a>upon to exhibit the ideas themselves in a
	tangible shape, and made out in all their
	parts and most beautiful forms. The poet
	may write with a limited knowledge of his
	subject, and he may produce any partial
	view of it which his powers enable him to
	exhibit in a striking manner; but the successful
	painter must do all this, and he
	must execute with his hand as well as conceive
	with his mind. The poet, too, has
	the advantage of exhibiting his ideas in
	succession, and he avails himself of stops
	and pauses; but the great painter is obliged
	to set his entire subject before the eye
	at once, and all the parts of his composition,
	his imagination, and his execution,
	challenge the judgment as a whole. A
	great poet is nevertheless a just object of
	admiration among ordinary persons—but
	far more so a great painter, who assumes
	the power of creation, and of improving
	on the ordinary combinations of the Creator.
	Yet such a man was <em class="special_name">Thomas
	Gainsborough</em>, before whose modest
	tomb I stood!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page387" title="387"> </a>The following are the words engraven on

	</div>

	<p>A little to the eastward lie the remains
	of another illustrious son of art, the modest
	<em class="special_name">Zoffany</em>, whose Florence Gallery,
	Portraits of the Royal Family, and other
	pictures, will always raise him among the
	highest class of painters. He long resided
	on this Green, and, like Michael Angelo,
	Titian, and our own <em class="special_name">West</em>, produced
	master-pieces at four-score. The words
	on the monument are:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page388" title="388"> </a>It was a remarkable coincidence, that
	the bones of <em class="special_name">Gainsborough</em> and <em class="special_name">Zoffany</em>
	should thus, without premeditation,
	have been laid side by side; and that, but a
	few weeks before I paid my visit to this

	drawn together to view their principal
	works, combined with those of <em class="special_name">Wilson</em>

	<p>This valley of the Thames is, however,
	sanctified every-where by relics which call

	characters of his time. And, but a mile
	on my left, in Richmond Church, lie the
	remains of <em class="special_name">Thomson</em>, the poet of nature,
	of liberty, and of man—who displayed his
	powers only for noble purposes; who scorned,
	like the vile herd of modern rhymesters,
	to ascribe <em>glory</em> to injustice, <em>heroism</em>
	to the assassins of the champions of liberty,
	or <em>wisdom</em> to the mischievous prejudices
	of weak princes; and who, by asserting
	in every line the moral dignity of his
	art, became an example of poetical renown,
	which has been ably followed by
	<em class="special_name">Glover</em>, <em class="special_name">Akenside</em>, <em class="special_name">Cowper</em>, <em class="special_name">Robinson</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Burns</em>, <em class="special_name">Barlow</em>, <em class="special_name">Barbauld</em>,
	<em class="special_name">Wolcot</em>, <em class="special_name">Moore</em>, and <em class="special_name">Byron</em>.</p>

	<p>The fast-declining Sun, and my wearied
	<a class="pagenum" id="page390" title="390"> </a>limbs here reminded me that I was the
	slave of nature, and of nature’s laws; and
	that I had neither time, nor power, to excurse
	or go farther. My course, therefore,
	necessarily terminated on this spot;
	and here I must take leave of the reader,
	who has been patient, or liberal enough,
	to accompany me.</p>

	<p>For my own part, I had been highly
	gratified with the great volume, ten or
	twelve miles long, by two or three broad,
	in the study of which I had employed the
	lengthened morning; though this volume of
	my brief analysis the reader will doubtless
	find marked by the short-sightedness
	and imperfections which attend every
	attempt of human art to compress an infinite
	variety into a finite compass.</p>

	<p>In looking back at the incidents of the
	day, which the language of custom has,
	with reference to our repasts, denominated
	<strong class="special_emphasis">THE MORNING</strong>, I could not avoid feeling
	the strong analogy which exists between
	such an excursion as that which I have here
	described and <em class="special_name">THE LIFE of MAN</em>. Like
	that, and all things measured by <strong class="special_emphasis">TIME</strong> and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page391" title="391"> </a><strong class="special_emphasis">SPACE</strong>, it had had its <strong class="special_emphasis">BEGINNING</strong>—its
	eventful <strong class="special_emphasis">COURSE</strong>—and its <strong class="special_emphasis">END</strong> determined
	by physical causes.</p>

	<p>On emerging in the morning, I foresaw
	as little as the child foresees his future life,
	what were to be the incidents of my journey.
	I proceeded in each successive hour
	even as he proceeds in each year. I jostled
	no one, and no one disturbed me.
	My feelings were those of peace, and I
	suffered from no hostility. My inclinations
	were virtuous, and I have experienced
	the rewards of virtue. Every step
	had therefore been productive of satisfaction,
	and I had no-where had cause to
	look behind me with regret.</p>

	<p>In this faithful journal, I have ventured
	to smile at folly; I have honestly
	reprehended bad passions, and I have sincerely
	sympathized with their victims.
	May all my readers be led to smile, reprehend,
	and sympathize with me; and I solicit
	this result—for their sakes—for the
	sake of truth—and in the hope that, if our
	feelings have been reciprocal, our mutual
	labours will not have been wasted! At the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page392" title="392"> </a>end of my short career, I conscientiously
	looked back on the incidents of my course
	with the complacency with which all may
	look back in old-age on the incidents
	of well-spent lives. Let no one sneer
	at the comparison, for, when human
	life has passed away, in what degree are its
	multiplied cares and chequered scenes
	more important than the simple events
	which attend a morning’s walk? Look on
	the graves of that church-yard, and see in
	<strong class="special_emphasis">THEM</strong> the representations of hundreds of
	anxious lives! Are not those graves, then,
	said I, the end of thousands of busy cares
	and ambitious projects? Was not life the
	<strong class="special_emphasis">MERE DREAM</strong> of their now senseless tenants—like
	the trackless path of a bird in
	the air, or of a fish in the waters? Were
	they not <em class="special_name">the Phantasmagoria</em> which,
	in their day, filled up the shifting scene
	of the world,—and are we not, in our
	several days, similar shadows, which modify
	the light for a season, and then
	disappear to make room for others like
	ourselves? May not the events of a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page393" title="393"> </a>morning which slides away, and leaves no
	traces behind it, be correctly likened therefore
	to the entire course of human life?
	The one, like the other, may be well or
	ill spent—idly dissipated or beneficially
	employed;—and the chequered incidents
	will be found to be similar to those which
	mark the periods of the longest life.</p>

	<p>In conclusion, I cannot avoid wishing
	that my example may be followed, in other
	situations, by minds variously stored and
	directed by different inquiries. Like the
	day which has just been recorded, the incidents
	of every situation, and the thoughts
	which pass without intermission through
	every mind, would, in a similar portion of
	time, fill similar volumes, which, as indices
	of man’s intellectual machinery, might
	serve the purpose of the dial of a clock, or
	the gnomon of a sun-dial, and prove agreeable
	sources of amusement, as well as
	efficacious means of disseminating valuable
	principles and useful instruction.</p>

			<p>It is difficult to assign limits to the gradual effects of the circuit of the waters by evaporation and rain on the creation of land, from the decay of vegetable organizations. All the rain which falls on such a country as England, from two to three feet deep per annum, tends to raise the surface of the soil with the substances generated by it, which we call solids. How small a portion reaches the rivulets, and how little returns to the sea! The consideration seems at least to justify the notion, that the waters desiccate in spite of the encroachments of currents, and that all things have proceeded from the silent agency of water.

			<p>As doctrines about fate and necessity involve a numerous class of mischievous superstitions, and are the bases of the success of endless impostures, it seems worth while to turn aside for a moment from the high road of my narrative to examine them. Some philosophers assert, that we are the inert patients of necessary causes: others, that we do what we list, without any cause, on the spontaneous impulse of our will: while nine-tenths of the human race maintain that we are governed by an unalterable fate, which is predestined, and that all the events of life take place for the sake of accomplishing some end! What is our real condition? We exist on a globe which, by a balance of mechanical powers, moves round a centre of gravity between it and the centre of the sun; and also round its own centre of gravity, communicating its aggregate motions to all the particles that compose it, and thereby exciting them into various modes of action, producing and sustaining all the phenomena which we witness. The entire mass then is the patient of these arrangements, and every thing on the earth is physically subservient to them. But, in animal organizations, we find a set of powers different from those which characterize inert minerals or plants. An animal has his own powers of loco-motion—he moves on his own centre of gravity—and, though the earth is his stage and the place of his origin, yet he is an independent Microcosm. To assist his loco-motion, to enable him to determine his course, to preserve his being, and to choose between what is good for him, and what is evil to him; he is provided with senses, with which he sees, hears, smells, tastes, and feels; with memory; and with powers of reasoning by analogy, or his senses and his experience would be useless: and yet men say, that such a creature is as much the patient of physical causes, as a stone or a plant! On the contrary, is it not evident, that an animal possesses peculiar powers of sense and reason, in order that he may not be the patient and victim of physical circumstances? But, say they, his actions are determined by his motives, and these are governed by causes over which he has no control; those causes are necessary, and, therefore, his actions are necessary. True—but these exterior causes (granting that they are always necessary links of a chain,) operate on a man only according to his estimate of them, which varies in different men, and in the same men at different times. The causes, at least as far as regards beings which are really their patients, may be regarded as necessary, and they may govern passive existences with absolute dominion; but in all animals they have to encounter the principle of individuality, the feeling of independence, the desire of well-being, and the energies of self-love. These, so to speak, enter into an argument with the causes—a process of reasoning takes place—a decision of judgment is formed—and that judgment it is which directs the will and the action. In other words, an erroneous and varying judgment interposes between the causes and the action; consequently, however absolute and necessary may be the causes, the action governed by an intervening imperfect judgment, and a varying estimate of these causes, is not equally absolute and necessary. Place ten men, or animals, in the same critical situation, and their judgment of the circumstances will lead each of them to act differently; though the necessary causes which ought to have governed their actions were the same; but their judgments, their knowledge, or their experience, were different, and, therefore, their actions. If animals were omniscient, they would have perfect judgments, which would exactly accord with the exterior or necessary circumstances, by which they might then be said to be governed; or, if they were stones and plants, they might be inert patients. But theirs is a mixed species of existence, they are neither plants nor gods. They have powers which plants have not, by which they can freely judge of the means of averting many palpable dangers; though their powers of judging are too limited to enable them to estimate all circumstances correctly, and therefore to move in necessary unison with the immutable physical laws that govern the changes and the motions of inert matter.

			<p>While these pages were printing, the Common Council of London, the second deliberative assembly in the empire, have presented an address to the Throne, in which they describe the late devastating Wars as “RASH AND RUINOUS, UNJUSTLY COMMENCED, AND PERTINACIOUSLY PERSISTED IN, WHEN NO RATIONAL OBJECT WAS TO BE OBTAINED;” and they add, that “IMMENSE SUBSIDIES WERE GRANTED TO FOREIGN POWERS TO DEFEND THEIR OWN TERRITORIES, OR TO COMMIT AGGRESSIONS ON THOSE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS.” No friend of Truth could wish to see a more correct historical record of these melancholy events; and, whether the authors of them are allowed to drop into the grave by the course of nature, or should expiate their offences on a scaffold, there is not likely to be much difference of opinion about them in the year <strong class="special_emphasis">THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED</strong> and <strong class="special_emphasis">SIXTEEN</strong>. Perhaps <strong class="special_emphasis">FIVE MILLIONS</strong> of men, and as many women and children, have fallen victims, in the space of twenty-five years, to attempts, as visionary as wicked, to destroy by the sword the assertion of Principles of Political Justice, which necessarily grew out of the cultivation of reason, and which were corollaries of that <strong class="special_emphasis">INTELLECTUAL PHILOSOPHY</strong> of which <em class="special_name">Bacon</em> laid the foundation, and which has been matured by <em class="special_name">Selden</em>, <em class="special_name">Coke</em>, <em class="special_name">Milton</em>, <em class="special_name">Sidney</em>, <em class="special_name">Locke</em>, <em class="special_name">Bolingbroke</em>, <em class="special_name">Montesquieu</em>, <em class="special_name">Blackstone</em>, <em class="special_name">Rousseau</em>, <em class="special_name">D’alembert</em>, <em class="special_name">Hume</em>, <em class="special_name">De Lolme</em>, <em class="special_name">Mirabeau</em>, and <em class="special_name">Fox</em>.

			<p>The box-wood used in England by the engravers on wood is often twelve inches in diameter; this, however, is not of English growth, but comes from Turkey, where it is held in slight estimation. Of course, when engravings on wood are larger than twelve inches in diameter, two blocks are joined together, for it is only the transverse section that can be wrought for this purpose. The most famous plantations of box in England are on the White-hill, near Dorking; but the trees there are mere sticks and shrubs compared with those at Mortlake; yet many of them are known to be two hundred years old.

			<p>The system of Physics which I have for many years inculcated, in the hope of removing from Philosophy the equivocal word <em>attraction</em>, supposes that space is filled with an elastic medium,—that this medium permeates bodies in proportion to their quantities of matter,—that resistance or re-action takes place between the universal medium of space and the novel arrangements of matter in bodies,—that this action and re-action diverge in the medium of space from the surfaces of bodies,—and that, like all diverging forces, they act inversely as the squares of the distances. That, if there were but one body in the universe, it would remain stationary by the uniform action of the surrounding medium,—that the creation of another body would produce phenomena between them, owing to each intercepting the action of the medium of space on the other, in proportion to the angles mutually presented by their bulks,—that two such bodies so acted upon by an universal medium must necessarily fall together, owing to the difference between the finite pressure on their near sides, and the infinite pressure on their outsides,—that a stone falls to the earth, because, with regard to it, the earth intercepts an angle of 180° of the medium of space on its near or under side; while, with regard to the earth, the stone intercepts but a small proportion of a second,—that these actual centripetal forces are very slight, between such distant bodies as the planets,—and, that the law of the forces is necessarily as their bulks directly, and as the squares of their distances inversely. That the centrifugal forces result from the same pressure or impulse,—that the varied densities of the opposite sides of the masses, as land and water, occasion a uniform external pressure to produce rotation on an axis,—that the action or oscillation of the fluid surfaces, a consequence of the rotation, constantly changes the mechanical centre of the mass, so as thereby to drive forward the mathematical centre in an orbit,—and that this is the purpose and effect of the tides, increased by the action and re-action of the fluid and solid parts. That centripetal and centrifugal forces so created, are necessarily varied by the diverse arrangements of the solid and fluid parts of planetary bodies, as we see in the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth,—and that hence arise the varied motions, the elliptical orbits, and all the peculiar phenomena. Attached as the moderns are to the terms <em>attraction</em> and <em>repulsion</em>, I produce this theory with due deference to their prejudices; and I venture to presume, that, on examination, it will be found to be a fair induction from the phenomena, and also in perfect accordance with all the laws of motion. It accounts for the uniform direction and moderate exertion of the centripetal force towards the largest body of a system; for the mutual actions of a system of bodies, or of many systems, on each other; and for the constantly varying direction of the centrifugal force, by shewing that it is generated within the mass. The term <em>repulsion</em> is even more disgraceful to Philosophy than that of <em>attraction</em>; all repulsion being in truth but a relative phenomenon between at least three bodies; and its most palpable appearance in electricity being but a stronger mechanical action towards opposite surfaces. The local impulses of magnets, and of bodies going into chemical union, are not better explained by Kepler’s gravitating sympathy, than by this doctrine of mechanical interception; but, I have no doubt that the former of these will, in due time, be traced to the difference between the rotary motion of the Equatorial and Polar regions; and the latter to some laws of the atomic theory, arising out of the shape and arrangement of the component particles, with reference to those of surrounding bodies.
